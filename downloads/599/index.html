<p>Bai Donglin's expression loosened, and he looked at the divine stone in his hand with burning eyes. At this time, "Qing Yi" was wrapped in a light film that only he could see. Countless mysterious runes are intertwined.</p>
<p>The causal line of this tributary has also been cut off, and all traces have been covered up. He believes that apart from him, under the eleven realms, there is no existence to see what he has done.</p>
<p>After confirming again that there is no problem, Bai Donglin gently tossed the palm of his hand and put the divine stone back in place.</p>
<p>He didn't intend to take this divine stone. If the divine stone disappeared after the Bronze Immortal Hall was opened, it would probably affect the various plans that followed.</p>
<p>One of the five coordinates is indispensable, and one piece on him is enough.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"It's better that this **** stone falls into the hands of the first evil god, then, before the wall is broken, the aliens can be kicked out of the game."</p>
<p>Although the aliens are the most fanatical and most keen on breaking the wall, in Bai Donglin's view, they can use the aliens as cannon fodder, but they must not be allowed to enjoy the fruits of breaking the wall.</p>
<p>"The safest way is to kill them all. I didn't have this idea before, but when the world line is unified, this alien cannon fodder is no longer meaningful..."</p>
<p>clang! hum—</p>
<p>As the last coffin was swallowed, the crystal cusp was successfully integrated into the battle monument, humming crisply, slowly rotating under the shroud of six-color brilliance, like the center of everything, exuding a vast aura all the time.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, it saved me a lot of time this time."</p>
<p>Raising his hand, the battle monument fell into his hands obediently, and at the moment when he touched the monument, an endless stream of information suddenly poured back into the sea of ​​​​gods.</p>
<p>The quantum cloud vortex, like a greedy beast, devours and digests the flood of information.</p>
<p>One of the eight, "The Same"!</p>
<p>Yuguang is the same as the dust, the four internal parts have been collected, only "Wind" and "Fire" representing speed and attack are left.</p>
<p>The information instilled by the battle monument is not only that, the billions of inheritances inscribed on the coffin of the saint are also absorbed. Apart from that, there was nothing else, which made Bai Donglin slightly disappointed. He wanted to know more about the war and the black disaster.</p>
<p>"Too greedy, this time the harvest is already great."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head and laughed, and scolded himself for being insatiable. He finally glanced at the space of the Immortal Palace, and as soon as his figure moved, he disappeared.</p>
<p>The Bronze Immortal Hall may be missing the core component of the Hall of Prayer for the Dao, and its original power has not been manifested. Apart from these things displayed in the void, there is nothing that can make Bai Dong feel at ease.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Whoa whoa whoa!</p>
<p>kill-</p>
<p>As soon as he appeared outside the Immortal Hall, he was overwhelmed by the roaring roar and killing. Bai Donglin's will swept past, and he saw ten extremely huge light **** in the surrounding void.</p>
<p>Each of the current light spheres has more than 10 million fused together, and its inner world is even more boundless. More than 10 million medium-thousand worlds are forcibly mixed together. In terms of light size, it is no less than a large thousand worlds. .</p>
<p>"So fast?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin was a little surprised. Obviously, this has entered the final decisive battle. The top ten will be born soon, which is much faster than the time he calculated.</p>
<p>With a thought, the resurrection was in the World Lord's Mansion, and the disconnected connection with the clone was restored, and the memory was instantly synchronized.</p>
<p>"Brother!"</p>
<p>Two surprise shouts sounded in the hall, it was Bai Yaoguang and Emperor Bai Xuan, Bai Donglin frowned, and he already understood everything.</p>
<p>The reason why the speed of the competition is accelerated is because the supply of Xianguang is lost, the efficiency of elimination is increased by dozens of times, and there are even cases of perishing together from time to time.</p>
<p>"Poison Fang, Miaomiao, dead?"</p>
<p>Bai Yaoguang and Bai Yaoguang felt the coldness radiating from Bai Donglin's body.</p>
<p>"Brother..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin raised his hand and stopped Bai Yaoguang to continue. He already knew the specific situation through his clone.</p>
<p>Poison Fang Miaomiao died in battle, and he had to bear a lot of responsibility. First, the clone he left behind did not have much combat power, and he couldn't hide himself, so he couldn't break the isolation of the bronze fairy hall and save him Poisonous teeth.</p>
<p>Second, it was because of him that he took away the things in the bronze immortal hall, causing the immortal light to disappear, completely disrupting the competition order he originally deduced.</p>
<p>"Hey, this silly girl, how can you be so strong? If you can't beat it, can you just admit defeat?"</p>
<p>While speaking, Bai Donglin lowered his eyes and glanced at His Highness' younger siblings. Both of these guys voluntarily admitted defeat.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Cough, elder brother, please listen to my explanation, it's not that I don't want to fight, but that guy is so disgusting, vomit~ Now that I think about it, I still want to vomit!"</p>
<p>Bai Yaoguang was a little embarrassed to see, but talking, he couldn't help but feel sick.</p>
<p>Emperor Bai Xuan looked calm, because he was lucky enough to meet his eldest sister Bai Yuanzhen, so he resolutely conceded defeat.</p>
<p>"Girl, don't underestimate that guy too much. Although they are disgusting, but if they really want to fight, you are not his opponent."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head slightly, Yaoguang's opponent was from the Evil God Realm, and was the most filthy and evil existence. The world of light he was in was all polluted by assimilation, turning into black blood, rotten flesh, maggots, stumps, and vomited excrement. ...The deformed world gathered together is extremely distorted, crazy, disgusting and perverted, and all kinds of words can't describe it.</p>
<p>Bai Yaoguang, a quiet little girl who loves beauty, asked her to fight against this existence, and it would be strange if she didn't escape.</p>
<p>"Forget it, it's not bad to be in the top 50. It's impossible for all the luck to fall into our family."</p>
<p>"Lord Brother, Miaomiao... can she come back?"</p>
<p>Bai Yaoguang hesitated to speak, she was a kind-hearted person, and although she had only been in contact with Poison Fang Miaomiao for a long time, she still had feelings in her heart. After all, she was also the 12th landlord.</p>
<p>"Well, don't worry, the girl is lucky, the true spirit has not been destroyed, and there is a chance to return. I will leave this matter to a professional person."</p>
<p>"The loss this time is not entirely a bad thing for her."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin pondered a little, Poison Fang Miaomiao was at the bottom of the Twelve Masters because of his background. Although Ren Wufeng came from grass roots, he still had a rare bloodline of undefeated fighting body.</p>
<p>"Reincarnated and reincarnated, this time, let's arrange a good birth for her."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin flicked his finger, and a stream of information converged into a lasing out, and disappeared into the dimension.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>It would be best to leave this matter to a professional like Moro. While Moro was working for him, it was easy to take a little time to find the true spirit of Venomous.</p>
<p>"Hmph, but this matter can't be left alone! How can anyone in Bai Yujing be able to kill anyone? If the other party is a human race, that's fine, but it's a flat-haired beast, or my most hated golden-winged beast. Dapeng Clan!"</p>
<p>Although it was a fair competition, he was just trying to play tricks. Who would call the opponent a bird monster? Something that will be destroyed sooner or later, it is also harmless to let it out in advance.</p>
<p>"Master, this kind of trivial matter, leave it to Ah Mo to do it!"</p>
<p>Ah Mo stood under the throne and bowed slightly, no one would have imagined how terrifying power was hidden in this withered and old body.</p>
<p>Although the grave-watcher is not well-known, only a few ancient beings know about it. Whenever Kun's End Realm encounters a crisis, in the non-existent nineteenth-level plane, a **** hand will stick out, annihilating all intruders.</p>
<p>The grave watcher is an ancient powerhouse with the same reputation as the angler, and is the most peak existence in the ten realms.</p>
<p>"Well, well, do it a bit cleaner."</p>
<p>"As ordered!"</p>
<p>Ah Wu took the order, took a step back, and disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>The main force of the demon clan is now gathered in the frontiers of the universe. In their base camp, there are some old, weak, sick and disabled, and the ten realms left behind are not the opponents of Ah Mo.</p>
<p>With proper arrangements, Bai Donglin no longer cares about this matter. If today's arrogant battle is about to end and the real drama is about to be staged, it is naturally difficult for him to leave.</p>
<p>"Little guys, hurry up, I can't wait..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin got up slowly, his eyes shining with strange brilliance, swept across the world of light **** one by one.</p>
<p>As if hearing his whispers, the Twelve Landlords, who were still testing, looked stunned, and their breath became extremely violent.</p>
<p>"kill-"</p>
<p>"Eternal silence!"</p>
<p>Bai Jiange stepped on the broken galaxy, his eyes overflowing with murderous intent, he stretched his right hand behind his head, firmly grasped the sword of annihilation, and drew a line slightly.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Woohoo!</p>
<p>The silence whimpered, and the gray-white sword light flashed away, shooting into the deep space of the universe.</p>
<p>On the other side of the galaxy, stands a world of flesh and blood that spans the boundless void.</p>
<p>puff-</p>
<p>The gray-white sword light, lingering with the incomparably terrifying meaning of annihilation, penetrated everything, annihilated everything, and pierced into the world of flesh and blood irresistibly.</p>
<p>The deformed and twisted behemoth was smashed by the sword light, and it shattered like a bubble. All tangible things and intangible meanings were destroyed.</p>
<p>Squeak! hoo hoo hoo-</p>
<p>Ahhh!</p>
<p>The power of ancient artifacts, how can a **** and demon be able to compete? What's more, it was a pure killer weapon like the Silent Demon Sword. Without the slightest surprise, the genius of the Heretic God Realm was instantly stunned.</p>
<p>"Hey! This, this is... unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"Another Chaos Lord!?"</p>
<p>What is the biggest surprise that Bai Donglin brought to the Ten Realms? It is not tenacious vitality, nor is it illegal combat power, but that when he is in the realm of gods and demons, he can motivate the real ancient artifact.</p>
<p>The eyes of the masters are so vicious, they naturally see the extraordinary sword behind Bai Jiange, but they never thought that it could be activated. How similar is it to the master of chaos?</p>
<p>Are all white people so perverted?</p>
<p>"Bai Jiange, it really is you!"</p>
<p>In the central shrine, the sword master stood up suddenly, looking at Bai Donglin for a while, and Bai Jiange for a while, with inexplicable meaning.</p>
<p>Sword masters of all dynasties have a common mission, and that is to activate the "Xianxian Sword Array" to achieve the long-cherished wish of countless sword cultivators, and to set up the Zhu Xian sword formation that dominates the killing of the heavens!</p>
<p>But the "spirit" in the Zhuxianjian array diagram has long since disappeared, and without the existence of the array spirit, this long-cherished wish will never be realized.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>The turning point of the matter appeared in the third ancient era, the seventeenth generation sword master, who found a way out of nowhere, and proposed the idea of ​​​​reviving the spirit of the Array.</p>
<p>With special means, the residual traces, breath, and unknown meanings in the array are collected, merged into a strange light, thrown into reincarnation, and turned into a real spirit with the help of the power of the mother river.</p>
<p>According to the deduction, the spirit of the formation map will come to the world at the crest of this era, the sword master has been searching hard, and the four kendo holy places are doing their best to recruit kendo geniuses.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the spirit of the array map has a peerless talent in kendo, which is also the only way for the sword master and others to distinguish.</p>
<p>The sword master had long suspected that Bai Jiange was the one they were waiting for, but Bai Jiange's true spirit talent was blue, not the highest purple. Therefore, he has been hesitating between Bai Jiange and Jian Feijian. Jian Feijian's kendo talent is also very strong, and his true spirit is still a purple talent.</p>
<p>But now it has finally been determined that in the realm of gods and demons, there is only one possibility to activate sword-shaped ancient artifacts. Bai Jiange is the reincarnation of the spirit of the array map.</p>
<p>"Many kendo ancestors, we have succeeded, we have really succeeded! The first killing sword formation, the Immortal Executioner, is finally coming into existence!"</p>
<p>Even the extremely cold-tempered Sword Master couldn't control his emotions at this time, but he carefully hid his emotions. Bai Jiange's identity must not be revealed, otherwise he would face the crazy assassination of aliens.</p>
<p>In this world, I am afraid that it is the alien race of the monster race, and the most afraid of the appearance of the Sword Array.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes moved slightly, and he glanced at the sword master who suddenly stood up, a thoughtful look flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p>Bai Jiange slashed the enemy forcefully, as if he had opened the horn of the attack, and the rest of Tianjiao also made a bold move.</p>

<p>hold head high-</p>
<p>Bai Yuanzhen was surrounded by the dragon of faith, the emperor's prestige was deep and vast, and the world was dark and gloomy with a single instruction.</p>
<p>The sleeper from the ancient times, the supreme arrogance of the dragon family, the nine-headed and nine-color glazed divine dragon, was pointed by the slender jade fingers across the galaxy, and his heart was inexplicably cold.</p>
<p>"This woman..."</p>
<p>"very scary!"</p>
<p>puff! Nine muffled sounds sounded at the same time, the hardest nine-colored inverse scales on the glass dragon's body were all penetrated, and the soul dragon **** were all turned into nothingness.</p>
<p>He didn't even know how he died.</p>
<p>"This is my way, the power of faith."</p>
<p>Bai Yuanzhen stood proudly with her hands closed, feeling the other side of the starry sky, the cheers of countless people of the Great Xia Dynasty, and the power of fiery beliefs kept emerging in her heart.</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth rose slightly, she did it, the little girl whose true spirit was red, with the inheritance in a scroll of mysterious jade slips, walked out of the avenue to the sky.</p>
<p>"Time Wheel Tomb · Infinite!"</p>
<p>Countless exiled immortals appeared in the starry sky, and at the same time, they punched out, covering the twisted darkness of the universe, and were instantly annihilated.</p>
<p>"Xiao Zi, you have really become very strong, and now you have surpassed me, I admit defeat!"</p>
<p>Bai Xiaoxiao was out of breath, and his luck was not very good. He and Xiao Zi were assigned together. The two were destined to eliminate one. After fighting with all their strength, he found that he was no longer Xiao Zi's opponent.</p>
<p>"Hey, this is what you said. You used to be stronger than me, so I followed your **** and called me boss."</p>
<p>"Now the feng shui turns, you see me later, you want to call me big sister!"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi crossed her chest with her hands, her purple hair was flying, and her face was triumphant.</p>
<p>"no!"</p>
<p>Bai Xiaoxiao heard the words, her old face darkened, she raised her hand to put on her sunglasses, and refused decisively.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Finally, I'm finally going to fight with you monsters! God Wuque, you are the same, right? Boiling fighting intent!"</p>
<p>Blade Wufeng held a sword and stared at the black and white world in the starry sky. In the center of the world where the yin and yang merged, there was a ruthless man with half-white and half-black hair hovering.</p>
<p>"A good fighter stands in an invincible position without losing the enemy's defeat."</p>
<p>"Battle Array Yin-Yang Mooke World!"</p>
<p>"kill-"</p>
<p>At the end of the endless Tianjiao battle, there are only twenty Tianjiao left, and the chances of the twelve masters meeting are still very high.</p>
<p>"Hey! The Lord of the Heart Tower has won again, do you understand? How did she do it?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I don't quite understand. She doesn't seem to take action, right? This is what she said, and the opponent suddenly went crazy and exploded. It's weird, it's really weird!"</p>
<p>The Lord of the Heart Tower, that is Lianxin, to say that this Tianjiao battle, that Tianjiao has gained the most, is undoubtedly her.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of heaven and earth darlings gathered together, fierce confrontation, the turmoil of heaven and earth was unprecedentedly intense, the compass of heaven and earth madly swallowed and merged, strengthening every moment, and even the earth list was completely condensed.</p>
<p>The pity that can penetrate the secret is undoubtedly terrifying. All the details of the opponent are under her observation. It only needs a little targeted means to end the battle.</p>
<p>At this point, the battle of the twelve landlords is almost over, and the six landlords, Emperor, Jian, Zi, Xin, Xian and Wu, have entered the top ten.</p>
<p>Such an exaggerated record has made countless creatures remember the rising terrorist force of "Bai Yujing", and also deeply remember the twelve landlords, these twelve evildoers.</p>
<p>The name of Bai Yujing has now resounded throughout the world!</p>
<p>The masters of the central temple also frequently looked at Bai Donglin's avatar, the Lord of the Divine Court who was hiding on one side, and his expression was even more gloomy and ugly. The geniuses they sent did not have a top ten, and losing countless gambling money was a trivial matter, just a face. Some can't hang up.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"The top ten are decided, and the battle of Tianjiao is about to end..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin was sitting on the throne of God, and the terrifying momentum in his body was faintly showing signs of awakening. He couldn't wait to make a big fight.</p>
<p>Endless Tianjiao Battle Rules: In the top ten battles, the ranking is based on the time it takes to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>This may be a bit unfair, but for Tianjiao, luck is also a part of strength. Many beings present deeply understand this and naturally understand.</p>
<p>From Bai Donglin's point of view, I'm afraid it's not so complicated. It's just that the old gambling dog, the Wandering Emperor, has a gambling attack, so this kind of rules will be set.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Central Divine Court Realm, the Kuihe Transcendent Galaxy Cluster, the headquarters of the Inspector.</p>
<p>In the depths behind the main hall of the inspector, stands an extremely tall mountain. It is almost high, and the clouds are only at the foot of the mountain. The top of the mountain is deeply inserted into the void of the universe. 's residence.</p>
<p>On the side of Duan Wang Cliff, Lin's bedroom shone with gorgeous brilliance, and layers of secret runes completely blocked the palace.</p>
<p>"Zhilu, you bastard! Let me go out! I'm going to the frontiers of the universe too, and I'm going to witness the endless battle of arrogance with my own eyes!"</p>
<p>"I'm mad at me! I'm mad at me! Everyone can watch the battle, why can't I!?"</p>
<p>Lin was so angry that her cheeks were bulging, she walked around in the courtyard, her resentment was very heavy, and she scolded Zhilu bloody.</p>
<p>Zhilu, who was sitting cross-legged in the void, shook his head helplessly, what could he do? He also obeys orders!</p>
<p>"I said auntie, just stop for a while. This time the top director gave a death order. Without his permission, I would never dare to let you out."</p>
<p>"Humph! Stop killing, wait for this lady, and when I become the top director, I will definitely give you small shoes!"</p>
<p>Zhilu's face darkened, just as he was about to say something, his figure suddenly froze, and his expression became solemn.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Follow your orders! Mr. Supreme Secretary!"</p>
<p>He bowed respectfully towards the void, then looked at Lin, a trace of complexity flashed in his eyes, and slowly said:</p>
<p>"Lin, you can go out now, the Supreme Secretary wants to see you."</p>
<p>After saying that, he raised his hand and waved, and a stream of light passed by, wrapping Lin and disappearing instantly.</p>
<p>Through teleportation over and over again, Zhilu took Lin to the most central part of the central Divine Court realm, the core secret place of the Divine Court.</p>
<p>"Lin, go in, the adults are waiting for you inside."</p>
<p>"Hmph, I just want to ask the old man why he grounds me!"</p>
<p>Lin was furious and stepped into the whirlpool in front of her.</p>
<p>The corners of Zhilu's mouth moved slightly, wanting to say something, but he sighed, watching the vortex channel disappear.</p>
<p>"Lin, I hope you'll be fine..."</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"Lin, you are here."</p>
<p>The top director of the inspection department, Zero, sat cross-legged on a jade platform engraved with runes. In the depths of the void above his head, he could faintly see the phantom of a behemoth.</p>
<p>That is, the real ancient artifact, the thirty-third heaven!</p>
<p>It is the court of God, and it is also the hiding place, the sleeping place of many strong people.</p>
<p>Zero's identity is not only the highest director of the Audit Department, but also the guardian of the Thirty-Three Heavens.</p>
<p>"Father, what are you looking for with your daughter?"</p>
<p>Lin, who said she wanted to question outside, seemed a little calm and even alienated at this time.</p>
<p>"Are you still blaming me?"</p>
<p>Lin was silent.</p>
<p>"Aren't you wondering, why do I put you in a deep sleep and keep you and your mother, brothers and sisters forever separated by the age gap?"</p>
<p>Lin's pupils shrank, and she naturally wanted to know. No matter what she asked before, Lingdu was silent. Today, for some unknown reason, she took the initiative to tell her.</p>
<p>"why!?"</p>
<p>Lin forced herself to calm down, but her eager tone still revealed the stirring emotions in her heart.</p>
<p>"Lin, you have important responsibilities. You are not only my daughter, but..."</p>
<p>"The reincarnation of the spirit of the thirty-third heaven!"</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Lin blinked her eyes with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>"What is the reincarnation of the spirit? What does this have to do with me entering deep sleep?"</p>
<p>"Lin, do you remember that when you were young, someone came to visit you from time to time?"</p>
<p>"You, are you talking about Uncle? Of course I remember, does it have anything to do with him?"</p>
<p>Lin Qiao blushed, her expression erratic, she didn't know what to think, the corners of her mouth rose slightly.</p>
<p>"He told me your true identity. Moreover, when you were young, your spirituality was unstable and almost collapsed. It was he who helped you survive by means of defying the sky."</p>
<p>"He said, you, born too early, appeared in the wrong era..."</p>
<p>"Yes, uncle, put me into sleep?"</p>
<p>Lin was taken aback for a moment, tears welling up in her eyes, as if she didn't want to accept this fact.</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"All right…"</p>
<p>Sleeping for a long time, UU reading www. uukanshu.com Lin's expression turned cold, her eyes darkened, and she slowly said, "What is the so-called responsibility? Since it is what Uncle wants to do, I will do it."</p>
<p>Ling suddenly stood up, stared at Lin, and said word by word:</p>
<p>"Entering the thirty-third heaven, eternal exile, its dormant master!"</p>
<p>"What did you say!?"</p>
<p>"Why, why do they do this, they are..."</p>
<p>"There is no reason! The wall is about to break, and the hidden power must be weakened!"</p>
<p>Zero's expression was cold, and she was different from usual, which made Lin feel a chill in her heart.</p>
<p>What is a broken wall? What is stealth?</p>
<p>The human race that has always been united, why, why is this happening? !</p>
<p>Lin froze in place, full of disbelief in her heart.</p>
