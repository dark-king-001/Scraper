<p>He should have died, but a trace of his will was escaping strangely under the wrapping of the true spirit.</p>
<p>"Is it another mother river corpse hunter?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin murmured to himself, just now there was a vague reincarnation fluctuation flashed by his will, which was very similar to the taste of Moruo.</p>
<p>As soon as he ran away, he didn't care much, it was a casual strike without killing intent.</p>
<p>The World Honored Shikong Buddha is also a supreme powerhouse who has left behind many legends. He was defeated so easily, which really shocked the onlookers.</p>
<p>"Good stuff, don't waste it."</p>
<p>A ray of black light rippled, and the two halves of the Buddha's golden body were instantly pulled into the dark world, and the matter was turned into energy. The rules contained in the particles, and the remaining information of supernatural powers and secret methods were all swallowed and digested, becoming the resources of one's own way.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>uh uh! roar roar-</p>
<p>The fierceness that escaped the lock in the distance, the black mist on the body surface became more and more dense, and the totem of the beast on the back seemed to come alive, looking indifferently, scanning back and forth, all the masters keenly felt a trace of hostility.</p>
<p>Fierce has completely lost his mind.</p>
<p>"Emperor, wait a moment."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin smiled apologetically at Daoist Ziwei, and pointed at the fierce who was about to run away, the meaning was self-evident.</p>
<p>This guy is quite polite!</p>
<p>Taoist Ziwei's brows trembled slightly. He also knew that World Honored Shikong Buddha had a means to save his life. He didn't get angry when he saw him being beheaded, but nodded his head very graciously.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>roar roar-</p>
<p>Bai Donglin, who was closest, became the first target to be attacked. In the violent roar, a black light instantly shot in front of him.</p>
<p>"It seems that I really lost my mind, and I can only rely on aura perception to defend the enemy."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes moved slightly, if he didn't take the initiative to show his breath, others would see him as a mere mortal. As soon as his mind moved, a strand of long hair stretched out from the back of his head, tightly binding the black light in front of him, unable to move at all.</p>
<p>"Senior fierce, bear with me, and you will be cured soon."</p>
<p>boom--</p>
<p>Scarlet Karmic Fire spewed out, all poured into Fierce's body, and it burned raging. The huge pillar of fire rose slowly, filling hundreds of millions of kilometers, and the terrifying scorching aura melted the boundary walls.</p>
<p>Uh ah ah! hoohoo!</p>
<p>Mourning, roaring, extremely tragic, many sleepers who do not understand the name "Lord of Sins", all have doubts on their faces, is this not going to eliminate the devil by hand?</p>
<p>How can there be such a person to save people, it is better to cut the matter with one knife, so as to avoid this inhuman torture.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Today's karma is really powerful, but in just a moment, the black mist on Fierce Li's body was eliminated, and the fierce beast totem on his back also closed his indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>"Um?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin frowned, waved his hand to disperse the karmic fire, and looked at the ferocious man who was extremely weak and on the verge of death, his eyes flashed with thought.</p>
<p>"This strong slaughter resentment is actually an inseparable body with Senior Fierce? One glory and one loss are all losses, but if it is not erased, it will infect Senior Fierce's will."</p>
<p>"The fierce predecessors on other world lines have not merged with the white crow until their death. It turns out that this is the reason."</p>
<p>After a little deduction, Bai Donglin thought of his plan to mass-produce Wallbreakers, which might be useful. Then he opened the Light Realm and temporarily banned Fierce Li.</p>
<p>"Okay, Emperor, let you wait for a long time."</p>
<p>woohoo-</p>
<p>In the dimensional space, a quiet voice whistled, and the repressed aura spread wantonly, and many rulers felt a chill in their hearts, looked at each other in dismay, and involuntarily retreated for tens of thousands of light-years.</p>
<p>"Your name is Bai Donglin?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to imagine that such a terrifying existence like you has been born in this era. With your strength, you can completely dominate the world and live happily for tens of billions of years. Why do you need to do something like breaking the wall and killing yourself!?"</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's eyes were complicated, looking at Bai Donglin, like an old friend he hadn't seen for many years, and chatting naturally, his words were full of regret.</p>
<p>"Hehe, 10 billion years? It's too short, my generation will live in nine deaths, and cultivate hard, naturally we must pursue eternity!"</p>
<p>"Besides, being trapped in this small cage, in my heart, I feel aggrieved and full of sense of crisis. I am not only afraid of dying from the exhaustion of my lifespan, but also of sudden sudden death. Do you really think that this cage Can you protect all beings forever?"</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Bai Donglin's eyes shone brightly, he made no secret of his ambition, and his will was unshakable.</p>
<p>"If you want to not die, you have to become stronger, stronger than the strongest!"</p>
<p>"Whoever stops me will die!"</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying breath spewed out, the endless dimensional power was disturbed, and the destruction storm condensed into a group, covering hundreds of millions of light-years.</p>
<p>"Wait, this is self-destruction!"</p>
<p>"Even if you can pass the level of the Mother River? Those terrifying beings outside will be able to swallow you to pieces in an instant..."</p>
<p>"enough!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes closed slightly, preventing the emperor from continuing to speak, his expression indifferent and determined.</p>
<p>"I said, whoever stops me will die, even those guys outside!"</p>
<p>"You guy..."</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's expression sank. He had never seen such a domineering and conceited existence, and his extremely tenacious will made him even more shocked.</p>
<p>"The way is different, don't work together, talk more is useless, let's fight! When I make a move, you will have no chance..."</p>
<p>"Humph!"</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's eyes turned cold and he gave up the idea of ​​lobbying. He admitted that Bai Donglin was indeed very strong, but he still had the confidence to subdue him, just like the Lord of All Saints.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, let this deity see where your confidence comes from..."</p>
<p>"as you wish."</p>
<p>A sneer flashed in Bai Donglin's eyes, and he didn't hold back. He immediately took down Daoist Ziwei with a single blow, shocking the hidden aura.</p>
<p>"Supernatural realm! Expand—"</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>A terrifying will that was invisible and intangible, unable to detect perception, enveloped a spherical area of ​​tens of billions of light-years in an instant.</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei, as well as nearly four hundred masters, were all covered.</p>
<p>"Here, I am the only creator of the world, who dominates all authority, and the will of heaven and earth must obediently retreat."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin took one step and came to the shocked Daoist Ziwei. The corner of his mouth rose. Anyone who was suddenly deprived of his trump card would show this expression, even if it was the emperor.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Possessing the Violet Qi and controlling the battle soul network, the power of heaven and earth can be said to be the source of Emperor Zun's strength. Now, in the super **** realm, which is isolated from heaven and earth, his strength suddenly weakens infinitely. , is not much different.</p>
<p>"You, how did you do it?"</p>
<p>Emperor Venerable's heart turned upside down, no matter how he sensed it, or how he stimulated the purple energy of Hongmeng, he couldn't attract the slightest power of heaven and earth. The most strange thing was that they were still in the only real world.</p>
<p>"Want to know? Hey, I won't tell you."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin smiled wickedly, then stretched out his palm and gently pressed it on the shoulder of Daoist Ziwei, the power of the source of the rules surged out, completely suppressing and banning him.</p>
<p>"Emperor, you are defeated!"</p>
<p>"Meow-"</p>
<p>Bing Miao moved her body in her arms, stretched out her fluffy palm, and shone bright and sharp claws toward Emperor Zun, as if to say, "Sample, is it still a cow?"</p>
<p>The deity lost?</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's expression was sluggish, and his heart was like a river and a sea. Until now, he hadn't figured out how Bai Donglin made his move.</p>
<p>The will of the Seven Realms, which has never left a trace in this world, has indeed violated some regulations, and even an ancient powerhouse like Emperor Zun cannot perceive a trace.</p>
<p>Click! rumbling...</p>
<p>Not far away, the world-destroying mill was spinning fiercely. Because of the loss of Daoist Ziwei's maintenance, the power gradually disappeared, and a huge fist smashed out. With a slight shock, the black and red vortex immediately dissipated.</p>
<p>"Emperor! You are just like that, you still haven't killed me!! Hahaha!"</p>
<p>The Lord of All Saints' eyes were fierce, and Chiguo's upper body was covered with wounds. Step by step, he stepped out of the light of destruction. He looked around, looking for the figure of Daoist Ziwei, but found that the atmosphere in the dimensional space was a little strange, and he couldn't help but stop laughing wildly.</p>
<p>The will was rippling, and many voices full of shock and inconceivable suddenly filled my mind.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Ah? That's it!? This is the end!?"</p>
<p>"What about the shocking battle?"</p>
<p>"This guy, Emperor Zun, isn't he fake?"</p>
<p>The many rulers in the distance looked at each other and couldn't believe the scene in front of them. You have to say that after a tragic fight, and then you were defeated by one move, this is also the past.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's because Bai Donglin is too strong? The emperor is not a one-shot enemy?"</p>
<p>"No way……"</p>
<p>"Is it so scary?"</p>
<p>If it weren't for the fact that they are all supreme masters and need to maintain a certain level of force, at this moment, it is estimated that they would have to shout "such horror"!</p>
<p>"Emperor, can we sit down and talk now? Talk about your compensation."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked leisurely and said unhurriedly, and he didn't really mean to kill them all. The emperor and the master of the hidden side were only opposed to them because of their different ideas. After all, they were the patron saints who made great contributions to the human race. .</p>
<p>Could the human race have survived until now without their hard work one by one? Then he Bai Donglin still has this superior growth soil?</p>
<p>Although he is not a good person, but there is no need for him to kill the donkey.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that Emperor Zun and the others are still very useful, and there is still a broken arm waiting to be dealt with in the Heretic God Realm.</p>
<p>"As for this battle, I will accept the spoils that I should have."</p>
<p>Having said that, he stretched out a virtual palm and submerged into the emperor's body. With one slash and grab, he took out a group of glorious purple streamers.</p>
<p>"The deity's primordial purple energy!"</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's eyes widened as he watched helplessly as his big treasure was taken away.</p>
<p>"What's yours and mine, isn't yours mine? Why are you so divided?"</p>
<p>"And, didn't I leave some for you? Don't delay your control of the power of heaven and earth."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin waved his hand, pretended to be angry, and admired a few eyes of Hongmeng Purple Qi with great interest, and then included it into the Light Realm.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Perceiving that there was only a wisp of Hongmeng Purple Qi left in the Daoji, Daoist Ziwei wanted to cry without tears, but who told him that his skills were not as good as others, it was a fluke to have a life left, and it would be gone if he lost a few things outside his body.</p>
<p>"In the name of the master, open, the highest meeting of the human race!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's expression became solemn, his will was wrapped in many masters, and he stepped out in one step, and came to Tianwaitian, the central temple.</p>
<p>"By the way, I almost forgot about you."</p>
<p>click-</p>
<p>The void shattered, a big hand protruded from the scarlet crack, and the angry-looking Earth King, together with a large section of the long river of time and space, were all caught in their hands, and instantly retracted into the sky.</p>
<p>"Bai Donglin..."</p>
<p>"What kind of existence are you?"</p>
<p>Jiang Wudao looked at the healed scarlet crack with an extremely complicated expression, as if he had just taken a nap, and he couldn't understand it in this world.</p>
<p>"Old, really old!"</p>
<p>Jiang Wudao shook his head and stroked his beard, stepped out, returned to the shore of Taihu Lake, and turned into an ordinary fishing old man again.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>clang! clang clang!</p>
<p>Nine bells rang through the sky, representing the highest-level meeting of the human race, and it started.</p>
<p>"Uh, Zi Wei, what's the situation?"</p>
<p>Nan Bo was forcibly pressed on the throne by a big hand, and his mind was still stunned. For a moment just now, he thought he would be pinched to death.</p>
<p>"Can't you see it yourself?"</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei's tone was very unpleasant, and after replying angrily, he closed his eyes and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Tsk, why are you so angry? I didn't mess with you..."</p>
<p>Nan Bo whispered, his eyes moved slightly, and he looked around, and found that not only them, but almost all the rulers of the human race were present, and they all looked at the towering **** in the center with complex expressions.</p>
<p>"Fellow Daoists, thank you very much for participating in this meeting concerning the future of the human race. I am Bai Donglin, the initiator of this meeting."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Bai Donglin sat cross-legged on the throne, caressed Bing Miao in his arms, and said with a kind face, still so elegant and easy-going, impeccable.</p>
<p>Listen, what is this called?</p>
<p>Are there opportunities for them not to participate? I haven't figured out what's going on, and in the blink of an eye, I was captured in the central temple.</p>
<p>"Before the meeting starts, Lord of the Ghost Palace, please open the Eighteen Hells. Those dormant masters should all wake up at this time."</p>
<p>The sleepers in the ghost mansion naturally belong to the side of the broken wall. Those sleepers merge with him and me, and their wills have awakened. The state at this time is the same as that of Ji Dao Bell.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>The Lord of the Ghost Mansion nodded slightly. Now it seems that the battle of breaking the wall is really coming. It is no longer necessary to continue to sleep.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Ghost Mansion moved extremely fast, and through the transfer of Battle.net, it took dozens of breaths to return to Tianwaitian with nearly a hundred terrifying figures.</p>
<p>Buzz! Kaka-</p>
<p>Unprecedented will coercion floods the central temple, this is just an unconscious natural escape, and it is about to collapse the temple.</p>
<p>Two hundred for the hidden side, three hundred for the broken side, a total of nearly five hundred and ten realms dominate!</p>
<p>Except for the exiled Thirty-three Heavens, almost all of the supreme combat power of the human race is here.</p>
<p>The human race claims that the highest combat power with humans is only two hundred. It can be seen that because of the differences in ideas, how much power is involved in the human race.</p>
<p>If Qi Xin goes outside, where is there any chance for this group of clowns from different races to show off their power?</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes moved slightly, and he swept a master from the eighteen hells. He couldn't help nodding slightly. There were three guys, and their aura was extraordinarily powerful, far superior to the ordinary ten realms.</p>
<p>Emperor Ziwei, the earthly king Nanbo, the sage of Wensheng Palace, the World Honored Shikong Buddha...</p>
<p>The Lord of All Saints, Bing Meow, God and Human Wuyou, and the ghost Shura who just returned from hell, A Tai is in trouble, and the red gold is brilliant.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>These slumberers are all very remarkable beings. With their bare hands, they can smash ordinary ten realms holding ancient artifacts. Such a combat power that is different from ordinary people makes Bai Donglin look sideways.</p>
<p>Among the other human race masters, there are very few that can compare with them, and only the blood slaughter and sword master who have merged with him and me are barely able to fight with one.</p>
<p>"I will preside over this meeting. Do you have any comments?"</p>
<p>"I have no opinion!"</p>
<p>"Seconded!"</p>
<p>The rulers of the broken side all stood up and offered their hands, giving Bai Donglin enough face. After saying that, he stared at the many rulers hiding on the side with eyes that could kill.</p>
<p>It seems that if he hears a word, he will immediately perform a full martial arts.</p>
<p>"Seconded."</p>
<p>Emperor Zun took the lead in expressing his position, and the other prime ministers glanced at him and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>There is no way, the situation is stronger than people, they can't beat them, there are not many people, the boss has spoken, and obedience is.</p>
<p>"very good!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked around, paused for a moment, and continued:</p>
<p>"The difference of ideas is irreversible. Sooner or later, there will be a war between us. This is an unavoidable fact."</p>
<p>The will of the ruler should not be underestimated. Even if he knew he would die, he would carry it out. Not to mention that most of them, the billions of years of lifespan are coming to an end, and they have no shortage of these tens of millions of years.</p>
<p>Therefore, Bai Donglin directly gave up the idea of ​​persuading him to surrender, just as Emperor Zun couldn't change him, he couldn't convince the hidden party.</p>
<p>There is a mother river behind the people, and it is not known who will win and who will lose. This is the idea of ​​all the hidden masters.</p>
<p>"This battle, I want to put it down for a while. We are all the masters of the human race. All living beings regard me as the patron saint. Naturally, we must first consider the future of all living beings of the human race."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Killing to the death and fighting to the death, wouldn't it be ridiculous if the alien monster clan took advantage of it in the end?"</p>
<p>"So, before breaking the wall, let's solve the alien monsters first, so as to eradicate the worries of the ethnic group forever. Wouldn't it be beautiful if we all fight to the death and me?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked at Emperor Zun and others with a smile in his eyes. He believed that the hidden party would agree, because it would be beneficial to them.</p>
<p>"By the way, fellow Daoists of the beast clan, don't get me wrong, the monster clan I'm talking about naturally doesn't include you."</p>
<p>"The Lord of Chaos is serious, we can save it!"</p>
<p>A silver-gray unicorn with a length of more than ten light-years, lying prone in the void, nodded friendly to Bai Donglin, without the slightest dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The beast family also belongs to the firm wall-breaking side.</p>
<p>"To eradicate the hidden dangers of the human race, the merit is in the future, and it is naturally feasible."</p>
<p>Daoist Ziwei nodded slightly, the aliens and monsters are keen to break the wall, if the human race wall breaker is in a hurry, he is afraid that the two sides can unite and get rid of them in advance, which is naturally the best.</p>
<p>This is also the bottom line of the broken side.</p>
<p>Even now, he has not taken back the authority to use Battle.net from the wall-breaking party. The key is here. When the hidden dangers of the human race are eliminated, and the final decisive battle, the right to use Battle.net will naturally be withdrawn.</p>
<p>"Fellow Daoists, what do you think?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked around, although the emperor agreed, but it was a meeting after all, so we still have to respect the masters.</p>
<p>"Seconded!"</p>
<p>"good!"</p>
<p>"Amitabha! Slaying demons and eliminating demons is obligatory!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Jiliwa, five hundred masters, unanimously approved, in terms of caring for the human beings, everyone is still very harmonious and unified, and there is no such thing as an anti-bone boy who eats inside and out.</p>
<p>"So good, then let's discuss how to launch a comprehensive counterattack..."</p>
<p>"Be sure to fight and completely wipe out the hidden dangers of the human race!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the endless battlefield, a great formation with a terrifying breath, the giant sword slashed into the void, and countless sword lights lingered.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The space suddenly rippled with layers of ripples, and a figure stepped out, a body covered with scales, only six humanoids, with an extremely strange look, the eyebrows were split, and a pitch-black eyeball was spinning around.</p>
<p>This person is exactly the ten realms of alien races that have been exterminated - Tuo Na, who resolutely fled from extermination, still has not escaped the tragedy of being parasitized by dark eyeballs.</p>
<p>"Jie Jie Jie!"</p>
<p>"Bai Donglin! You can't think of it, right? This **** still has a chance to make a comeback, just wait, your physical body..."</p>
<p>Tuo Na's mouth didn't move, but there was a cold whisper in the void, the dark eyeballs turned strangely, staring at the Zhuxian Sword Formation, and countless twisted runes flashed in the depths of the pupils.</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch! After waiting for you for a long time, you are finally willing to come out!?"</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The void exploded, and a huge and majestic figure stepped out of the endless battlefield ~www.mtlnovel.com~ which was originally empty.</p>
<p>"What!? You..."</p>
<p>"Tsk, you pig brain, still want to break the Immortal Execution Sword Formation? Bring it to you!"</p>
<p>A look of mockery flashed in the eyes of the most evil, and he stretched out his hand to hold the tuo, and the power of endless suppression poured out, tying the dark eyeballs that wanted to escape into it.</p>
<p>swallow--</p>
<p>Tuo Na was swallowed into the stomach, instantly erasing all the source particles, and completely dead, the next moment, the dark eyeballs with nowhere to escape, can only helplessly parasitize in the center of the most evil eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Hiccup~"</p>
<p>"Yes, everything is planned."</p>
