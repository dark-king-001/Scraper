<p>"Is it above the sky? The sect where the master is located is really like him, so domineering!"</p>
<p>Li You murmured inwardly, the light in his eyes was getting hotter and hotter, how high the world is, and there are many supreme forces in the world, dare to use such a name, naturally he has the strength to suppress everything.</p>
<p>He has never heard of Bai Yujing. It should be some kind of top hidden power that cannot be reached by ordinary people. It is like a master, or even stronger. There must be not a few in the sect, right?</p>
<p>Glancing at Li You, who was thinking wildly, Bai Donglin shook his head and laughed, this kid really dares to think.</p>
<p>Although there are some errors, there is no need to correct them. Bai Yujing surpasses the heavens, it is only a matter of time.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Li You, what exercises are you practicing now?"</p>
<p>"Return to Master! What my disciple is cultivating is the "Red Tiger Devouring Demons Sutra", which is a tenth-order collection obtained from the system."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes moved slightly, and behind Li You, he saw a roaring red tiger with its neck raised, it was quite powerful, and it was a collection of physical training.</p>
<p>"It's barely enough, but it's enough for you now."</p>
<p>Li You is pitifully weak. He has practiced for a thousand years and has just broken through the fifth realm. To some extent, the system has limited his cultivation talent.</p>
<p>Obviously there is a shortcut of the system in front of you, and there is no capital to get the antiquities, and even the momentum of letting go has been consumed by the psychology of wanting to rely on the system.</p>
<p>Whether it is high or low, it is the former Li You.</p>
<p>"In the early stage of cultivation, under the nine realms, the power of rules was never involved, it was just laying the foundation. I have nothing to teach you, and I am too lazy to teach those little things."</p>
<p>"Wait until you become a **** and demon, and then accept the inheritance of being a teacher."</p>
<p>Li You heard the words, his heart was cold at first, and then he reacted, the inheritance that Master can see, only the ninth-order can touch, isn't it strong enough to fly! ?</p>
<p>Why should you care about the current gains and losses, the later ones are the good ones, Li You instantly adjusted his mentality and bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>"Teacher obeys his orders, he must cultivate well and advance to the realm of gods and demons as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Knowing the advance and retreat, knowing the gains and losses, Li You's performance made Bai Donglin quite satisfied.</p>
<p>"good."</p>
<p>"Make good use of your talent system. It doesn't take much time in the early stage of cultivation. The system is from that person's handwriting, and there is a lot of potential to be tapped."</p>
<p>When he reaches the realm of the source of information, calling him by name and thinking of his shape will be reflected in his heart, and Bai Donglin will naturally not make such a low-level mistake.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Uh uh."</p>
<p>Li You scratched his head and looked a little embarrassed. How could the system be as strong as the master said? If there are no antiquities, it is a vampire who will kill him at any time, and the nameless stone tablet has also been taken away by the master. Kind to ask.</p>
<p>"Li You, do you know your system, what kind of occupation is most suitable for you?"</p>
<p>Seeing through the other party's thoughts, Bai Donglin reached out and turned over, took out a small white jade pagoda, and left it behind the main hall, which instantly grew to ten thousand feet tall.</p>
<p>"You are suitable to be a gatekeeper. From now on, you will guard the treasure house for me, Bai Yujing."</p>
<p>"I give you the ownership of the treasures inside."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin once went deep into Li You's system and knew the rules of its operation. He naturally understood that he needed the ownership of the treasure in order to absorb the time value, even if it was just a verbal promise.</p>
<p>Li You was stunned, his eyes passed through the portal of the Jade Pagoda, and he saw the treasures piled up like mountains in the vast space.</p>
<p>"Many, thank you Master!"</p>
<p>"I like to look at the gate the most in my life, the treasure house of the sect, just leave it to my disciples!"</p>
<p>"Go."</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Li You knocked his head loudly, and rushed into the Jade Pagoda with rolling and crawling, being shaken by the shining treasures, his heart trembled.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes closed slightly, flashing a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>"The essence of the system is to create anomalous rules by means of information editing. Well, it's a bit weird, and there are shadows of SCP containment..."</p>
<p>"It's just that it is controllable, and it is tightly controlled by the source of its creator's information. Abnormal information, abnormal rules, stocking up in this huge experimental field to grow wildly, raising Gu?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not so extreme. For the host and the source of information, this is a win-win deal. One side gets the power, and the other side gets the experimental data."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin pressed down his thoughts and did not dare to think too deeply. He only flashed a little thought in the "virtual personality", which was never revealed in the id's conscious thinking, preventing the formation of sympathy with the source of information.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>He raised his head and glanced at Li You, who was caught in a carnival, and ignored it. The treasures in the jade pagoda were all taken from the prisoner bird treasury, and the fairy crystal liquid was naturally digested by him.</p>
<p>He also disliked these "low-level" treasures. Before swallowing them, he would use the waste for Li You to drain the remaining value.</p>
<p>"Prisoned in the dark, right?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes moved slightly, and he looked at Li You as a "mountain". Since he appeared, he has been throwing himself on the ground, a prisoner of autism and five senses.</p>
<p>"The adults know clearly, the villains are prisoners."</p>
<p>Prison Ansheng "heared" the voice that sounded in his mind, his heart relaxed, he opened the blockade of his five senses, and kowtowed respectfully.</p>
<p>From being pampered, the eldest prince of the empire who controls the vast star field, to the servant who bows his head and listens, the prisoner has adapted very quickly to such a huge change of identity. It can be seen that he has a clear understanding of the cruelty in this world.</p>
<p>Maybe, he had also humbled himself in the immortal dynasty of the gods, so he was so skilled.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked at prisoner Ansheng with curiosity in his eyes. What he was curious about was not prisoner Ansheng himself, but where he came from.</p>
<p>"Prisoner Ansheng, you just came down from the battlefield?"</p>
<p>Prison Ansheng looked stunned for a moment. He didn't expect Bai Donglin to ask about this, so he reached into his arms and took out a numbered black iron token.</p>
<p>"Return to your lord!"</p>
<p>"It's true that the villain has just returned from the battlefield. According to the service rules of the "Code of Life", I still have 370,000 years to retire. I received a summons from the seventh sister this time, and I deliberately used the family leave once every 10,000 years. "</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded slightly, don't look at this prisoner Ansheng is so cowardly now, in fact, his strength is not weak, his cultivation has reached the ninth realm, and he is also a veteran.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Which battlefield do you belong to? Who are you serving under?"</p>
<p>"Sir, the villain is serving in the parallel universe numbered 'Binghai Qiqiwu'. He is currently fighting in the Howling Abyss Battlefield and belongs to the Black Prison Army."</p>
<p>Howling Abyss Battleground!</p>
<p>A terrifying battlefield that fights head-on with the Black Disaster!</p>
<p>The corners of Bai Donglin's mouth rose slightly, and his eyes flashed with excitement. Every time he made a fortune and rose, he was inseparable from war.</p>
<p>It can be said that when he went to the battlefield, it was like going home, and he liked going to the battlefield very much.</p>
<p>"How long until your vacation is over?"</p>
<p>Prisoner raised his head abruptly and looked at Bai Donglin incredulously, a trace of anger flashed in his dull eyes.</p>
<p>The "Code of Life" stipulates that no existence shall interfere with the implementation of the "Service Regulations", and shall not prevent a creature from entering the battlefield on time, unless the creature dies "accidentally".</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's implication was to let him go back to the battlefield? Stop killing him! ?</p>
<p>"Master, there are still three years left. According to the regulations, as long as I don't die, I must return to the battlefield after three years."</p>
<p>"Three years?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded slightly, there was still a little time left, just to deal with some things.</p>
<p>"Very well, before returning to the battlefield, come to see this seat, and I will go with you to the Howling Abyss."</p>
<p>"Thank you sir!"</p>
<p>Prison Ansheng forcibly suppressed the excitement in his heart, bowed his head respectfully, and slowly exited the hall.</p>
<p>"The little girl is imprisoning Miaokong, please see the adults."</p>
<p>Not long after prisoner Ansheng left, prisoner Miaokong came to ask for an interview. Apparently, she got some information from her own brother.</p>
<p>"Enter."</p>
<p>Prison Miaokong was dressed in plain clothes, her delicate face was pale and her brows were as red as blood. She was less graceful and cold than before, and she was a little more morbid and weak.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>It's not that she has other thoughts, it's just that the state at this time is like this, seducing a supreme powerhouse? This kind of thought can make people laugh out loud.</p>
<p>"Sir Saint Ann!"</p>
<p>Prison Miaokong knelt down on the ground, bowed his head respectfully, and behaved meticulously.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Jumping out at this time is nothing more than to survive. Bai Donglin asked knowingly, but he wanted to see what method this little guy would use to impress him.</p>
<p>"My lord, the little girl heard that you are interested in all kinds of rare treasures, and asked to see it, because she wanted to present the treasures she treasured."</p>
<p>After all, the jade hand turned over, took out three things, and placed them on the main hall in sequence.</p>
<p>"This is the Qiankun Jade Gourd, which is an innate spiritual treasure. It contains a vast space and carries an inexhaustible sea of ​​five-color wine. This alcohol is wonderful. Although it is useless for you, it is good for quenching thirst. ."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin cast his gaze down and saw through the details of the jade gourd. This so-called "innate spiritual treasure" is estimated to have come from a low-level prehistoric place.</p>
<p>That five-color wine sea, inexhaustible is also a virtual finger, although it has the effect of washing the marrow, but it is useless to him, it can only be used to quench thirst.</p>
<p>Seeing that Bai Donglin was unmoved, Prison Miaokong froze and pointed to another treasure.</p>
<p>"My lord, this egg contains a holy-level Zerg mother emperor, which can breed a tenth-level Zerg mother emperor. If the resources are sufficient, it can continuously provide low-level cannon fodder."</p>
<p>Another piece of shit.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head slightly, can't he use the resources himself? It's almost crazy to feed these ants.</p>
<p>Prison Miaokong showed a stern smile, and his expression was a little gloomy. Yes, in the eyes of adults, things she regarded as treasures were probably no different from soil.</p>
<p>Forced to cheer up, Prison Miaokong picked up the last treasure with both hands, which looked like a crystal ball.</p>
<p>"This thing is an initial small universe. The inner space is tens of millions of light-years. The most important thing is that it has given birth to a unique life."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"It is a kind of mechanical creature called silicon-based life. The civilization level has developed to the ninth level. Although its various scientific and technological achievements are far inferior to the outside world, there are some permissible advantages."</p>
<p>After saying that, Prison Miaokong knelt down again, with his forehead pressed against the ground, as if waiting for the verdict.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes flickered slightly, and he saw through everything about Prison Miaokong. From her birth to the present, everything she did was vividly remembered.</p>
<p>To say that this woman is a great villain, it really doesn't count, at least compared to the most vicious prisoners in the Heavenly Prison, there is no thought of letting him personally kill.</p>
<p>The evil things she did were nothing more than scheming and stealing treasures. Because of her noble birth, there were not many treasures that could make her move.</p>
<p>The reason why she took action to capture Li You should be because of her spiritual pupil talent. She sensed a little abnormality of the nameless stone tablet, which made her thinking crooked.</p>
<p>"Prison Miaokong."</p>
<p>"This seat has already handed you over to Li You. Now, of course, there will be no interference. Whether you live or die depends on my disciple's thoughts."</p>
<p>Hearing Bai Donglin's words, Prison Miaokong's face turned paler. In her opinion, Li You would definitely kill her if she had had enough fun.</p>
<p>"but…"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin paused and continued: "As far as I know, Li You is going to Pluto, and there is a blind and lame uncle who he values ​​very much."</p>
<p>"If you can think of a way to cure his stubborn disease, Li You might be able to dispel his resentment towards you."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Prison Miaokong's dim eyes suddenly lit up, grabbing the straw of life. The most important thing is that this suggestion was proposed by Bai Donglin, otherwise, she would not dare to contact Li You's uncle without authorization.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he took the three gadgets on the ground into his hands, and turned his eyes to the crystal ball universe. Everything inside came into his mind.</p>
<p>"Silicon-based life? Isn't this an enhanced Autobot? Interesting."</p>
<p>Glancing across the universe, he did not find the imaginary "Blue Star". In this small universe, there is only a single intelligent life, a mechanical creature.</p>
<p>Infinite mechanical beings live in this small universe for various goals. In their eyes, the universe in which they are located is everything known and unknown.</p>
<p>But they didn't know that they just lived in a crystal ball, and they were being played by a supreme being in the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>"The ninth-level civilization is not bad. When you break through to the tenth level, you will be able to see through the truth of the universe and start exploring the outside world."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin weighed the crystal ball. The ninth-level scientific and technological civilization is actually not low. Thinking about the Blue Star that he lived in in his previous life, the civilization level is extremely low, and he has not even mastered nuclear fusion. The power of civilization is impossible. Unification, meaningless internal friction, led to extremely slow development, barely considered a 0.7-level civilization.</p>
<p>"At this time, I am observing a civilization in the palm of my hand. Is there some existence that is also observing me?"</p>
<p>"Not too possible!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head and laughed, the trick of nesting dolls has lost its meaning here. The detached ones have transcended everything. Where there is their existence, who else can be above it?</p>
<p>"The development of civilization still has to be stimulated by external forces in order to advance by leaps and bounds."</p>
<p>While speaking, Bai Donglin threw the egg of the Holy-level Zerg Queen Mother into the cosmic space inside the crystal ball.</p>
<p>"The upper limit of the mother emperor is tenth-level, but it takes a long time to grow and develop. The civilization of mechanical creatures is not far from the tenth level. Both sides belong to the explosive force..."</p>

<p>Throwing the crystal ball on the throne, Bai Donglin looked solemn, took out the nameless stone tablet, placed it lightly on his legs, and stared at the blurred back.</p>
<p>At this time, there are no foreign objects in his body, because he wants to leave this place temporarily.</p>
<p>Hands clasped together, a strand of hair slowly fell.</p>
<p>"Destroy-"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's figure instantly disappeared and disappeared, the nameless stone tablet fell on the empty throne, and the hair fell on it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The only real world, the depths of the monument world.</p>
<p>The Tao in the sublime cultivation has no end, slowly opened his eyes, and looked at the rippling void in front of him, and then suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>"Deity, you are here."</p>
<p>"Ok."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded lightly, his will has spread silently, and in just an instant, the entire only real world was enveloped in it.</p>
<p>Looking at the thriving vast world and the many familiar and friendly figures, Bai Donglin's eyes softened, and he couldn't help but feel a lot more happy.</p>
<p>"This deity, need the ring of time and space?"</p>
<p>The ring of time and space, which is the only source of time and space in this world, obviously, Dao Wuzhong knew what Bai Donglin was going to do when he suddenly came back.</p>
<p>"No need."</p>
<p>"You haven't reached my realm at this time, you won't understand, the only real me has control over time."</p>
<p>With a smile in his eyes, Bai Donglin shook his head and rejected Dao Wuzhong's proposal.</p>
<p>"Your strength..."</p>
<p>There was a hint of surprise in Bai Donglin's heart, even though he had tried his best to overestimate the end of the Tao, it seemed that he was still a little misguided, and the breath exuding from his body made him feel a little troubled.</p>
<p>"Hehe, before I traveled to the ancient times, I have practiced for nearly three trillion years, and the spiritual world is a little bit stronger, which is reasonable."</p>
<p>"It makes sense."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded slightly in agreement.</p>
<p>"This is a very good signal, indicating that our idea is right. The infinitely amplified "Pregnant God Casting Demons" can indeed break the shackles of the realm."</p>

<p>The voice became indistinct, and before he finished speaking, Bai Donglin's figure had disappeared.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to that day."</p>
<p>Dao Wuzhong slowly closed his eyes, held the ring of time and space, and fell into cultivation again.</p>
<p>clap la la-</p>
<p>The invisible and invisible endless Styx is looming behind it, and every moment, it is carrying the dimensional power of the outer dimensional space.</p>
<p>After careful perception, the outer dimension space has shrunk to less than half.</p>
<p>The ancestral home of the Bai family, Xiaohui Mountain.</p>
<p>The void was slightly rippling, Bai Donglin stepped out of it, his eyes fell on the cliff, the lonely grave surrounded by flowers that never withered.</p>
<p>"Mother…"</p>
<p>Reaching out his hand and stroking the stone tablet, his eyes were full of complicated emotions. This is the place where Qing Ying rests, his biological mother he has never met.</p>
<p>Is this just family affection from blood?</p>
<p>In Bai Donglin's previous life, he was an orphan who grew up with no parents and no mother. He was born unexpectedly in this world, and because of his extraordinarily powerful soul, he exhausted his mother's source of life, causing him to die in childbirth.</p>
<p>It can be said that Qing Ying used his life in exchange for him Bai Donglin.</p>
<p>The aunt once told him that at the beginning, when all kinds of drugs could not make up for the lack of Qingying's origin, she suggested that Qingying give up the fetus in her belly and save her life, but she was rejected without hesitation.</p>
<p>'He is my child, my flesh and blood, even if he dies, I want him to be born in a safe and healthy way! ’</p>
<p>‘Sister, if I die, please take care of my child! ’</p>
<p>‘Sister, please tell my child that I love him for my mother, I’m not afraid of death, I just want to watch him grow up…’</p>
<p>Every time he recalled these words, Bai Donglin felt sore eyes. Although his mother was just an ordinary woman, in his heart, she was extremely great.</p>

<p>Bai Donglin looked solemn, the dazzling divine light in his eyes rose, the terrifying aura slightly escaped, and there were endless creatures in the real world, all of them trembled, and suddenly looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Daoyin roared, resounding across the world, like a promise from heaven.</p>
<p>"Time and space!"</p>
<p>"reverse-"</p>
<p>boom!</p>
<p>I saw that, with Bai Donglin as the core, in a spherical area with a radius of ten thousand miles, time and space were frozen in an instant.</p>
<p>Scenes from the past flashed in Bai Donglin's eyes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In a quiet and quiet building, there are three figures beside the stone table, chatting cordially.</p>
<p>"The avenue is long, how long it is, I hope our brothers and sisters can walk together all the way..."</p>
<p>"Goodbye little brother!"</p>
<p>"Big sister, second brother take care!"</p>
<p>This is the light and shadow dialogue he left with the big sister and the others.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A tall and straight young man knelt in front of the solitary grave and wrote deeply on the stone tablet with his fingers.</p>
<p>This is him. When he left the White House, he went to the wasteland to seek the Tao.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Xiaohuishan cliff, a shirtless figure jumped off again and again, constantly reincarnating in the shattered bones.</p>
<p>This is his reversal with the help of immortality and immortality, and he began a long and arduous practice.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"Wuwuwu, mother, I miss you!"</p>
<p>Under the dark night sky, a small figure was lying on the lonely grave and weeping loudly. When he was tired of crying, he fell into a deep sleep, and did not leave until dawn. The thin back of the mountain looked very lonely.</p>
<p>This is him when he was young. At that time, he had not awakened the memory of his previous life.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>boom-</p>
<p>The picture of the reverse flow, UU reading www.uukanshu.com is getting slower and slower, and finally, Bai Donglin sees...</p>
<p>"Hurry up! Madam can't do it! Please call the doctor!"</p>
<p>"My child, my child..."</p>
<p>Qing Ying was lying on the soft sleeper, her bones were dry, as if she had been drained of flesh and blood, her face was extremely pale.</p>
<p>The divine light in his eyes quickly dissipated, and he stretched out his palm in vain, trying to touch the chubby baby that was close at hand, but such a short distance was like a moat that could not be crossed.</p>
<p>"child…"</p>
<p>The pupils gradually enlarged, and when the palm was unable to fall, a large hand suddenly protruded from the void and held Qing Ying's withered palm tightly.</p>
<p>"Mother! The child is here to pick you up!"</p>
