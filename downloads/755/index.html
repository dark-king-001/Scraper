<p>Valgarda is an ancient local word, meaning - luck is on your side, but it's just a good wish after all. Every moment, I don't know how many gambling dogs have lost everything on this prosperous star, including the most worthless lives.</p>
<p>Tulan City, as the first casino city in Valgarda, covers an extremely wide area, with a total area of ​​one million square kilometers. Its core area is naturally the most popular gambling game "Yin-Yang Life-Death Map".</p>
<p>This is a Tai Chi gossip picture condensed from spiritless particles, suspended in the center of the hall, surrounded by gamblers with red faces, holding their lives in their hands, in order to turn over.</p>
<p>"Everyone, please start betting."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>With an order, the Taiji map drives the surrounding gossip symbols and begins to rotate rapidly. With each breath, it can rotate hundreds of millions of times. The special material prevents all cheating methods, and even the rules of fate cannot be added.</p>
<p>The rules are very simple. When the Taiji diagram is still, if you hit the gossip symbol corresponding to the yin and yang points, that is, the hexagram, you can get the compensation.</p>
<p>"The anode is three!"</p>
<p>"Cathode ridge six..."</p>
<p>"Cathode Kunba!"</p>
<p>Under the Tai Chi map, the gamblers were excited and threw out rare treasures, whether there was an owner or not. If you lose, you have to work for the casino and be a slave for life.</p>
<p>The smell of blood has stimulated all the gamblers to become more mad, and their reason is gradually lost under the greed and desire.</p>
<p>"Anode wing five, cathode shock four."</p>
<p>The faint voice fell, the hall suddenly fell silent, and everyone showed surprised eyes, looking at the young man with a calm expression.</p>
<p>Although this pressure method has the highest odds, it is extremely low to satisfy two hexagrams at the same time. Few people will do such a stupid thing for free.</p>
<p>"Hehe, it's really a newborn calf that's not afraid of tigers, so Meng Lang, he doesn't know how to die later."</p>
<p>The old gambling dogs shook their heads one after another, with sarcastic expressions in their eyes, waiting to see the young man's annoyed and regretful appearance.</p>
<p>Endless generals, fighting for their lives on the front line, and finally burying their bones in a foreign land, are these **** what they protect?</p>
<p>Li Youan sighed to himself, knowing that these things were unavoidable. The heavens are too vast, and there are always dark places. The objects they protect are not the people in front of them. The betting dogs are only protected by the shadow.</p>
<p>These people, when the 10,000-year period comes, also have to serve on the front line. Now they choose to lie down and fall, perhaps to escape the cruel reality and spend 10,000 years of drunken life and death. , the black disaster is too terrifying, and they are already cowardly before the battle.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Buy and leave! Go!"</p>
<p>"The hexagram, the anode is five, the cathode is four!"</p>
<p>wow—</p>
<p>All the gamblers turned pale with fright, and even the banker showed a strange expression, and they all looked at Li You, but they only saw calmness and indifference on the other side's face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Li You's pupils shrank sharply, showing a look of shock and anger.</p>
<p>hum!</p>
<p>Time and space rippled slightly, then completely froze, a blurry figure stepped out of nothingness, time moved for him, and the entire Vallgarda star fell into absolute stagnation.</p>
<p>"It's really enviable that he and I are avatars!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, but don't worry, this supreme treasure book will belong to this prisoner right away, General Li You, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Li You's expression is gloomy, he is not the deity, and the one who kills the enemy on the front line is not the deity, but they are all in the parallel universe of Guiqi, 516, and under the same time and space, their memories are in a state of communication at any time. Just now, he knew everything. , there is a clone that chooses to self-destruct.</p>
<p>The power of the eleventh realm is beyond his imagination. The battlefield of dirty soil is trillions of light-years away, but the prison master locked him in an instant and came across the realm.</p>
<p>"Prisoner, you won't succeed. Since you know the power of this inheritance, you should naturally understand that its creator is something you can offend? I advise you to do it yourself!"</p>
<p>  "Oh?"</p>
<p>The prisoner's brows and eyes moved slightly, he naturally considered these, so he conducted a thorough investigation on Li You.</p>
<p>"You have a background, but I don't?"</p>
<p>A boy from a humble background who didn't know where he got his adventures. He wanted to bluff him, but he really wanted to fight for the background. Who was he afraid of? Is the other side a joke in the end?</p>
<p>"Prisoner, you are dead."</p>
<p>"Hehe, I'll wait."</p>
<p>The prison master showed disdain, slowly raised his hand, and pointed at Li You's eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Destroy—"</p>
<p>At the critical moment, Li You self-destructed and dissipated.</p>
<p>"This inheritance is really extraordinary. It is possible to cultivate such a perfect consciousness, and it can even destroy itself under my nose."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Not only was the prisoner not annoyed, but he became more and more excited. He couldn't wait to find out Li You's body and force him to find out the supreme inheritance.</p>
<p>With a light step under his feet, the ripples of destruction rippled, and the star of Valgarda instantly turned to ashes.</p>
<p>The prison master glanced coldly, focused slightly on perception, and then stepped into time and space and disappeared.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The gray-haired fishing old man.</p>
<p>A beggar with a broken foot on the street.</p>
<p>The noble son who listened to the music in Goulan...</p>
<p>Li You cloned himself and me one by one. He was locked by the prison master and destroyed one by one. He went around in a big circle in the space-time of the universe, and finally returned to the battlefield of dirty soil.</p>
<p>"Li You, you really know where to choose."</p>
<p>The prison master frowned. He sensed the traces of Li You's consciousness, pointing to the source of the dirty battlefield, in that huge crack in time and space.</p>
<p>I have to say that Li You was very slick and hid in an area he was most reluctant to go to.</p>
<p>The strength of the space-time passage here is not high enough to carry a powerhouse like the eleventh realm. If he forcibly enters, there will be bad consequences, and even under the tearing of the two sides of time and space, it will affect his safety.</p>
<p>"Humph! Do you really think you'll be able to sleep at ease like this? You underestimate me too!"</p>
<p>Compared with the dangers that he may encounter, the value of the supreme inheritance is obviously higher, and it is worth his risk.</p>
<p>Without hesitating too much, the prison master, who had been impatient for a long time, took a few steps and went deep into the cracks in time and space. The terrifying aura spread violently, and the black disaster cannon fodder encountered along the way was all wiped out.</p>
<p>Kacha-</p>
<p>The twisted and hazy space-time channel, escaping and confusing the flow of time, vibrated violently at the moment when the prison master came, bursting open countless huge dark cracks, and illusory streamers shot out from the gaps.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>  "Humph!"</p>
<p>The prison master groaned in a low voice, his body was smeared by the streamer, and dense wounds appeared silently on the surface of the body, reaching the depths of the heart, and even the existence of the source could not avoid these strange injuries.</p>
<p>  "kill-"</p>
<p>A figure covered in blood and flames jumped out of the twisted space and time, held a halberd high, and slashed fiercely on the prison master's eyebrows, sparking bright sparks.</p>
<p>"Li You, you don't understand the power of the eleventh realm at all. Even in such a harsh environment, you can't hurt me in the slightest!"</p>
<p>The prison master's tall body was soaked in blood, and Li You's full-strength strike was just a tickling for him. What he was afraid of was the change in the space-time channel at this time.</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>"Bah, it seems that luck is not very good, the time-space channel has a tendency to advance."</p>
<p>The space-time channel is stimulated by external forces, and there is a very low possibility that the general intensity of stress will rise sharply. In this way, the powerhouse of the black disaster can pass smoothly. Moreover, this situation still exists unilaterally in the opening of the space-time channel, but the powerhouse on the black disaster side cannot use this method to increase the strength of the time-space channel with a very low probability.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the regulations, in principle, the prisoner cannot enter the space-time channel.</p>
<p>"Boy, I don't have time to play with you anymore."</p>
<p>The prison master looked indifferent, he needed to exit the space-time channel immediately, no longer talkative, raised his hand and grabbed to Li You.</p>
<p>It's over!</p>
<p>Has it ended?</p>
<p>A trace of unwillingness flashed in Li You's eyes. The cultivation of his and my avatars is not that simple. More than a dozen avatars have died, and only his deity is left.</p>
<p>He and I clones are relatively independent existences with their own self-consciousness, so killing him and my clones cannot be done with will residues, and the deity can be resurrected perfectly with the help of clones, which is a very powerful means of life-saving. I don't know how many times stronger than the particle clone.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Father and mother, I'm sorry..."</p>
<p>"Master, I'm sorry, my disciple has disappointed you. I can't even keep your old man's inheritance!"</p>
<p>Li You was in despair. The Eleventh Realm was too strong. The most terrifying thing was that the other party could manipulate the time at will. Whether it was self-destruction or self-cutting memory, it was useless.</p>
<p>He has no confidence that he can preserve the inheritance in the hands of the prison master.</p>
<p>"Have you given up struggling?"</p>
<p>The prisoner looked at Li You who closed his eyes and waited to die, a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth, and he closed his big hands, about to crush Li You into mud.</p>
<p>"Huh? What the hell!?"</p>
<p>Behind Li You's head, a strand of hair suddenly became golden and fell off automatically. Like a sharp sword, it slashed lightly and directly cut the prison master's big hand in half.</p>
<p>Perceiving the terrifying wave of destruction emerging, Li You opened his eyes fiercely with a look of surprise on his face.</p>
<p>"Master!"</p>
<p>It's not wrong, he sensed that above the golden hair, there is the aura of the master respecting his old man.</p>
<p>Poof—</p>
<p>The hairline slashed the prison master's palm with a single blow, but it also exhausted all his strength, trembled slightly, and disappeared.</p>
<p>This is just the hair that Bai Donglin took off shortly after breaking through the eleventh realm. The power contained in it is far from being compared to the present. With its extremely high essence, it is very important to be able to cut off the palm of an eleventh realm. strong.</p>
<p>"This kid..."</p>
<p>The prison master had a suspicious look in his eyes, and the severed palm grew out instantly. This kind of injury did not affect him. The reason why he was surprised was that he had doubts about Li You's background. The other party didn't seem to be as simple as he thought.</p>
<p>'That's it, so what? There is the ultimate other shore standing behind me, as long as it is not the supreme other shore, I don't need to be afraid! ’</p>
<p>The prison master frowned, staring at Li You with a surprised face, and pressed his big hand again.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Master, save me—"</p>
<p>Li You understood that although the master disappeared for more than 20,000 years, it wasn't that he didn't care about him. That hair strand was the proof.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Another strand of hair was automatically detached, twisted for a while, and turned into a big hand that covered the sky with golden light, and instead pressed **** the prison master.</p>
<p>"How dare you humiliate me with just a hair!?"</p>
<p>The prison master was very angry. Although he was the bottom of the eleven realms, he was not a single strand of hair left in the same realm that could be underestimated.</p>
<p>  "kill!"</p>
<p>One big and one small, one black and one gold, the two palms collided, and the violent tumultuous destructive fluctuations flowed freely in the space-time channel.</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>The space-time channel was affected by the aftermath, and the speed of its collapse suddenly accelerated. The black disasters felt the time and space in the sky, and suddenly gathered more and stronger space-time power, and the intensity of the channel suddenly increased.</p>
<p>  "not good!"</p>
<p>The prison master's expression changed slightly. Although he successfully eliminated the big hand that was formed by the hair, the breath that he tried to cover up was also revealed uncontrollably, causing the speed of the space-time channel to change greatly.</p>
<p>At this time, there may be a black disaster powerhouse who has sensed the change in the space-time channel, has stepped into it, and may come at any time.</p>
<p>The addition of Tongjing will push things into an unknown realm that cannot be controlled. The prison master, who knows this well, naturally does not dare to be neglected. With a movement of his figure, he pounces on Li You. The black light flashes on his palm, which runs through time and space. Li You's "Time File".</p>
<p>Time archives refer to the traces left by the living beings on the long river of time and space in the past from the beginning of their birth. After breaking through to the eleventh realm, the living beings will close the time line and merge these traces scattered on the time nodes into a The only "source of existence".</p>

No matter how Li You struggles to destroy himself, he can use the traces as an anchor to descend into the past space-time, and rub Li You at will.</p>
<p>"Hoohoho!"</p>
<p>"Jie Jie Jie—"</p>
<p>"Delicious scent, Tahoe Heavens?"</p>
<p>  not good! Come so fast!</p>
<p>The prison master turned pale with fright, and a figure of distorted and terrifying figure stepped forward from the end of the space-time passage, and the terrifying aura that escaped caused the surrounding distorted space-time to disappear one after another.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Die for me!"</p>
<p>Locked by the three Qi machines in the same realm, the prison lord's soul was swept away, but he still did not give up the duck to the mouth. He squeezed Li You to death with his big hand.</p>
<p>"No? How could this be? Impossible, impossible..."</p>
<p>The prisoner was stunned, he didn't capture anything, Li You's past was erased, and no trace was left.</p>
<p>"Could it be..."</p>
<p>The terrified, unwilling prisoner suddenly thought of something, and immediately extended his will to the extreme. Sure enough, in the extremely distant past, he sensed a flash of golden light, which was a shining strand of hair.</p>
<p>  "Do not-"</p>
<p>"Li You! You can't escape! The ends of the earth, this prison master will find you!"</p>
<p>The prison master raised his head and roared, full of unwillingness, turning into rolling waves.</p>
<p>"Little Yasan, what are you wailing here?"</p>
<p>The three black disaster powerhouses were extremely fast, and in just a short moment, they crossed a long distance and surrounded the prison master with a strange mockery on their faces.</p>
<p>Is this guy a fool?</p>
<p>As an eleventh realm, they actually stepped into the tenth-level space-time channel without authorization, and also caused the channel mutation to increase, saving them a lot of time.</p>
<p>That's right, the reason why they came so quickly was not accidental.</p>
<p>It has been less than 10 million years from the Daoyan of the heavens. The black disasters and the heavens have already begun to act. They have sent many eleven realms to invade the Taihao heavens through various channels, paving the way for the rear, collecting intelligence, and establishing fierce competition. Crossing the border to the altar...</p>

This selected space-time channel will be casted to increase its strength sooner or later, but that requires a huge price. Now, it saves a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>"Jie Jie, Xiao Ying San, in order to thank you for your help, we give you..."</p>
<p>  "die!"</p>
<p>The two sides are in different camps, and they are hostile at the root. Once they meet, they will be jealous and only kill them.</p>
<p>"It happened!"</p>
<p>Ling Li was a murderer, and woke the prisoner from his annoyance. His expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly sacrificed his ancient sword.</p>
<p>He has a short time to break through the eleventh realm, and he was able to obtain an ancient artifact, which shows that there are quite a lot of military materials for greed for ink.</p>
<p>But with the strength of the prison master, it is obviously impossible to defeat three with one.</p>
<p>Moreover, these three black disaster powerhouses can be sent to perform such a difficult task, their strength is obviously very unusual, and the prison master has no chance to escape.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the prison master was on the verge of death several times, his breath became extremely sluggish, and cracks were broken at the source of existence.</p>
<p>"Damn! I can't, can't die here..."</p>
<p>The prison master looked struggling. Today's ups and downs made him extremely uncomfortable. After hesitating for a moment, he reached into his arms and took out a bronze token with a vast aura.</p>
<p>"The Third Son of God! Save me!"</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>The token was crushed into pieces, and a cloud of blue light emerged, which suddenly unfolded into a curtain of light, faintly visible, among which a blurred figure sat cross-legged.</p>
<p>"To disturb my purification, if there is no satisfactory explanation, you can prepare to return to the ruins."</p>
<p>The cold and indifferent voice came out from the light curtain, which contained a terrifying and coercive atmosphere, causing the three black disaster powerhouses to stagnate in the same place, with a look of surprise.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Subordinates are guilty!"</p>
<p>The prisoner's body trembled when he heard the words, with a look of fear on his face, he buried his head deeply, and did not dare to look at the figure in the light curtain at all.</p>
<p>"The Black Disaster Rat? Humph! Die—"</p>
<p>The white hair fluttered slightly, and the blurred figure slowly turned his head, unable to see the twisted face, only a pair of blue pupils, extremely bright.</p>
<p>The pupils shrank, and two beams of light shot out, from the incomparably distant primordial universe to the other side, across the long river of time and space, parallel universes, and directly descended into reality from the illusory light curtain.</p>
<p>"Ah ah ah!"</p>
<p>"Not good! Run away!"</p>
<p>Horror, a wordless terror, exploded in the heart of the black disaster powerhouse, his scalp was numb, and his consciousness wailed and trembled.</p>
<p>The existence in the light curtain is very strong, far surpassing them, it is the absolute existence in the eleven realms, killing them is like slaughtering pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>The faint blue pupil light turned into a sword and a sword, and at an unbelievable terrifying speed, he instantly caught up with the black disaster powerhouse who was fleeing in a panic. human life.</p>
<p>"God is mighty!"</p>
<p>The prisoner's forehead was covered in sweat, and he swallowed hard. Even though it was not the first time he had seen the Son of God take action, his heart was full of disbelief.</p>
<p>As expected of the final other side, the infinite world is superimposed on one's own body, and in the same realm, it is an absolutely invincible existence.</p>
<p>The prison master's desire for this Dharma has risen to the highest level. If he can also reach this state, he is willing to pay all the price except his life.</p>
<p>  "explain."</p>
<p>The third goddess looked indifferent, looked at the prison master through the light curtain, and instantly killed three black disaster powerhouses, which seemed to him to be a trivial matter.</p>
<p>"Follow your orders, Lord Kamiko!"</p>

He knew that the Third Divine Son was not joking and would do what he said. If he could not satisfy the other party, the black disaster just now would be his end.</p>
<p>"It's like this..."</p>
<p>The prison master felt a little bitter in his heart. According to his original plan, he was going to take the inheritance into his hands and hand it over to the other side in person.</p>
<p>But now, the third son of the gods knows about this, and it is naturally not his turn to seize the inheritance. The great credit will be taken away by the son of god. Son of God, it is impossible.</p>
<p>But at least, after this incident, he can be considered to have left an impression on the upper echelons of the other side, which will be of great benefit to his future progress.</p>
<p>In order to save his life, the prison master told the third **** child everything in every detail, and then bowed and stood silently, waiting for the decision.</p>
<p>"Supreme Consciousness Cultivation Method, you can easily cut out his and my avatars..."</p>
<p>The face of the third god, Gu Bo, finally showed abnormal fluctuations. His eyes were slightly closed, and his face was thoughtful.</p>
<p>"Prisoner, with your knowledge, you can't tell the value of the Consciousness Collection, whether it's precious or not, but through your description of Li You's various cultivation achievements, in less than 10,000 years, he has cultivated eighteen Taegeum avatars. ."</p>
<p>"The consciousness is tenacious enough to be able to get rid of the suppression of your breath. Haha, it's interesting. Maybe it's a great inheritance."</p>
<p>The third goddess's eyes flickered, revealing the color of his heart. He is much more knowledgeable than the prison master, and he is more aware of the extraordinaryness of this inheritance. This may be a chance for rebirth for the other side.</p>
<p>This is a great credit!</p>
<p>  "very good!"</p>
<p>"Prisoner, although you are a little careful, you still want to bypass me to claim credit. Haha, but it's human nature. I can understand you."</p>
<p>"But this time, you have indeed made a great contribution, and this information can change your life. Don't worry, I will not treat you badly, and there will be a place for you in the future."</p>
<p>The third **** child was in a happy mood, as if the supreme inheritance had been in his hands, and he was no longer so harsh and harsh towards the prison master.</p>
<p>"Thank you God Son! Thank God Son!"</p>
<p>As if receiving amnesty, the prisoner fell to his knees and kowtowed repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Go, take a few personal items that are stained with Li You's breath, I will deal with trivial matters, and I will come as soon as possible..."</p>
<p>The light curtain collapsed and turned into bits of light. The irresistible indifferent voice echoed in the prison master's mind. UU reading www. uukanshu.com</p>
<p>"Follow your orders!"</p>
<p>The prison master kowtowed respectfully, then moved his figure and exited the space-time passage.</p>
<p>"The time and space channel intensity of the Dirty Earth Battlefield has been raised to level 11. This matter needs to be reported to the military headquarters and a stronger army will be dispatched to guard it."</p>
<p>The prison master pondered for a moment, then the figure dissipated and reappeared in the base camp of the Black Prison Army.</p>
<p>"Master Prisoner, are things going well?"</p>
<p>The void is rippling, and the black shadow military teacher manifests from the void, and he asks knowingly, in his opinion, there are eleven realms to shoot, and to deal with a ten realm, it is not a matter of grasping and sprinkling water.</p>
<p>"Hehe, everything went well."</p>
<p>The prison master smiled subtly, stretched out his palm abruptly, and pinched the black shadow strategist in his hand.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you?"</p>
<p>The soldier's figure trembled, he was unable to move, and there was something wrong in his heart.</p>
<p>"Dog thing, even Lao Tzu can only drink a little soup, water and water, how can you dare to have the idea of ​​sharing the supreme inheritance with me?!"</p>
<p>"With your self-proclaimed smart brain? Hmph, ignorance, ridiculous!"</p>
<p>Not daring to have the opportunity to beg for mercy from the military advisor, the prison master tightened his hand and completely wiped out the shadow.</p>
<p>"Huh, feel more comfortable."</p>
<p>The prison master's expression relaxed, and the suffocation in his heart eased slightly. Gradually, a fierce look appeared in the depths of his eyes.</p>
<p>'Third Son of God, wait, one day, I will trample you under my feet! ’</p>
