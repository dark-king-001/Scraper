<p>Located in the core area of ​​​​Wanzu, it is the supreme heaven that has stepped out of the narrative-level transcendence - "The Wheel of Origin of Four Colors", suppressing the boundless time and space, with unparalleled power.</p>
<p>There are endless heavens in the vortex of heavens ruled by all races, and each side of the heavens, no matter how strong or weak, has its own special features and focuses on aspects.</p>
<p>Just like the "Cangyue Zhutians", because of the origin of the four-color wheel, it has absolute authority in the way of information. It is the holy place for countless eleven-level powerhouses to practice "information", and it is said to be the best place to go. Not too much.</p>
<p>However, in order to safeguard the interests of local monks, the Cangyue Zhutians are extremely strict with the issuance of cross-border quotas, or they have made great contributions to all ethnic groups, or made a lot of military exploits on the battlefield of the black disaster, or paid a lot of resources. Step into the Cangyue Heavens.</p>
<p>Of course, those who think they are powerful can also choose to smuggle in, but they have to be mentally prepared to be held by the "Blue and White Foundation" on the charge of black households.</p>
<p>"The origin of the four-color wheel, ink, blue, white, and yellow, is it them?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes narrowed slightly as he stood in the realm of nothingness. The majestic sky in front of him was reflected in his secluded eyes, and the deepest memory in his mind slowly emerged.</p>
<p>"Quad in one, or something else?"</p>
<p>Shaking his head gently, there is too little known information to analyze. In short, this transcendental person who also came from the Blue Star of Origin Point has also spread the traces of existence, and he is one of the carriers.</p>
<p>"Let's go and see what these little guys are doing!"</p>
<p>The twelve masters of Baiyujing, the five major city masters, except Bai Jiange, including Xuetu and others, are now in the Cangyue Heavens.</p>
<p>"Meow-"</p>
<p>The smile in Bai Yuanzhen's eyes was still on the side, Bing Meow in his arms was lazy, whimpering faintly, and Zhan Lan Tong Kong stared at Bai Donglin, ready to move, as if he wanted to throw himself into the other's arms.</p>
<p>"Well, you are still obedient, Kitty, and didn't follow them around."</p>
<p>"Meow~"</p>
<p>Bing Meow is very happy to be praised.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Bing Miao and Bai Donglin have a close relationship. She was born in the ancient times of the only real world. Her body is a chaotic ice crystal, and she is born with wisdom after receiving Tao without end.</p>
<p>This is why, after Bing Miao woke up from her deep sleep, she was so familiar and attached to Bai Donglin. Even now in the eleventh realm, she did not choose to transform into a human form and speak human words, because she knew that once she did this, Bai Donglin would no longer be able to hold her in his arms.</p>
<p>The two walked on the long river of time and space with one cat and one sword, and within a few steps, they came to the main hall of the Time and Space Administration.</p>
<p>"Sir! What are your orders?"</p>
<p>The two of Bai Donglin did not conceal the breath of the other side. Immediately, there were observers who came to meet with their own bodies, with a respectful tone and a low posture.</p>
<p>The strong can be respected no matter where they are, this is the iron law.</p>
<p>"No big deal, give me a few places to enter Cangyue."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin flipped his palm and showed a token that lingered with time and space fluctuations. This little thing was given to him by Zhuoyun, the director of the Perfect All Heavens Time and Space Administration Branch, so that he could contact him at any time.</p>
<p>"This is……"</p>
<p>When the observer saw the token, his heart suddenly trembled, and his demeanor became much more respectful.</p>
<p>"Sir, the matter of the quota is very simple, just right, we still have a lot left here."</p>
<p>After saying that, with a flip of the palm, four light **** shot out and disappeared in Bai Donglin and the others.</p>
<p>All beings with self-awareness are called beings, so Crying Blood also gets a place.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"No, no! It's just a trivial matter, please walk slowly, my lord!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin left the hall, stepped out directly, and entered the world of Cangyue Zhutian. The reason why it was so troublesome was not because he was afraid of the Blue and White Foundation, but because of his respect for the detached.</p>
<p>Just like the observer just now respected him, he naturally also respected the wheel of origin of four colors. If someone else took that step before him, they naturally have this qualification, and nothing else.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Cangyue Heavens are the highest planes. Hundreds of billions of years ago, two new forces appeared, one was the Purple Jade Temple and the other was the Heart Palace.</p>
<p>Both of them have mysterious origins. They have powerful men like clouds, and they have a lot of wealth. They have recruited a lot of evil spirits and talents. They have always developed vigorously. Except for those top forces that have the other side, they can be called one-sided overlords.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that the two forces do not know what kind of grievances they have, and they are tit-for-tat everywhere.</p>
<p>Purple Jade Temple, deep in the core.</p>
<p>The master of the hall, Bai Xiaozi, is sitting on the throne, wearing a luxurious robe, the purple hair spreads out like a waterfall behind, the purple light flows in the breathtakingly beautiful eyes, the breath is strong, the pressure is very heavy, and the time and space are faintly distorted by the oppression. .</p>
<p>The long years have passed, and Xiao Zi is no longer a little girl. It has grown completely, and the peerless elegance is not enough to describe it. All the beauty in the world seems to converge on that breathtakingly beautiful face.</p>
<p>"Little, how is the exploration of the magic ear secret realm going? Is there any action in the heart palace?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi's tone was indifferent, her sharp eyes looked down, and many of the powerhouses standing above the hall couldn't help lowering their heads, daring not to meet that line of sight.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaoxiao heard the words, a trace of bitterness flashed in his eyes, and his thoughts were like a mess, he never thought that things would develop to this point today.</p>
<p>The twelfth landlord is really falling apart. When it's over, will the eldest brother beat him to death when he comes back?</p>
<p>He was really helpless. The reason why he came along with him was because he was worried that Xiao Zi and Lian Xin and the others would have a real fire, so he got involved in it to ease the deal.</p>
<p>"Return to the Palace Master!"</p>
<p>"The exploration of the secret realm went very smoothly. As for the heart palace, according to the informant, their attention was all on the blue sea. This time, it seems that they have no plans to oppose us."</p>
<p>"Humph! Even if they are acquainted with each other, the master of this hall is also going to kill them all without leaving behind!"</p>
<p>The corners of Xiao Zi's mouth rose, her eyes flickered, full of pride, almost revealing her true self, breaking the majesty of the hall master.</p>
<p>Fortunately, everyone below buried their heads and did not see this scene, only Bai Xiaoxiao shook his head with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"By the way, where did Miracle go recently? Without her by his side, the temple is still not very safe."</p>
<p>Miracle is the thug she managed to fool, and her strength is even far greater than her.</p>
<p>"This... let's go to find Lord Miracle!"</p>
<p>"Humph! A group of rice buckets, you can't even look at everyone?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi frowned and drank coldly, the violent aura poured down, scaring a group of Shijing's bodies to tremble.</p>
<p>"Yo, isn't this Xiao Zi? When did you become so domineering? Tsk tsk tsk!"</p>
<p>I couldn't hear the happy and angry laughter. It came from the void, and everyone in the hall felt dazed for a while, and then they found that their horizons collapsed crazily and pulled away, as if they were constantly moving away from the temple. The figure of the lake stepped out of nothingness.</p>
<p>He waved the idle and miscellaneous people back, and before he finished speaking, Bai Donglin had already stood in front of the throne, raised his hand, and flicked his fingers.</p>
<p>clang!</p>
<p>The brain that can shatter the universe collapsed directly into the heart of Xiao Zimei, and the surrounding time and space instantly collapsed and disappeared into an infinite black hole.</p>
<p>"Big, big brother! Be gentle, don't kill Xiao Zi!"</p>
<p>Seeing this terrifying scene, Bai Xiaoxiao's brows jumped in fright. Big brother is really angry. With his strength, it is naturally impossible to stop anything, so he can only persuade him.</p>
<p>"Brother, you are finally willing to come back, Xiao Zi misses you so much..."</p>
<p>Xiao Zi's eyes were blurred, her eyebrows were cracked, and she could even see the vortex of thinking, but she didn't seem to notice, she just stared at Bai Donglin in front of her, as if she was still reminiscing about the warmth of her fingertips.</p>
<p>"Giggle, eldest brother, do you want to kill Xiao Zi? Xiao Zi is wrong, and it's not your punishment, but, are you going to kill your child together!?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi's laughter was crisp, and the pale face under the serious injury looked a little morbid.</p>
<p>"what!?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's expression froze, what are you kidding? He hasn't done anything, but has been away for a while, and even has children? Could it be that the surname is Wang Bucheng?</p>
<p>He just wanted to teach Xiao Zi a lesson, where would he want to kill, he raised his hand and waved, and the injury on Xiao Zi's eyebrows disappeared like a bubble, and everything returned to its original state.</p>
<p>"Tell me, what's going on?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's brows were slightly wrinkled, and under his gaze, there was indeed an abnormal aura of life in Xiao Zi's abdomen. It seemed that a small life was being conceived, and there was an obscure connection with him on the bloodline.</p>
<p>"Hee hee, Xiao Zi knows that big brother is reluctant to kill me!"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi lightly raised her jade hand, brushed the messy purple hair on her forehead, and then gently pressed it on her lower abdomen, revealing a look of doting and anticipation.</p>
<p>"Brother, have you forgotten?"</p>
<p>"Xiao Zi, you grew up with your essence and blood, and your blood is flowing in my body."</p>
<p>"Isn't it easy to strip out your blood with my power?"</p>
<p>"Big brother, even if Xiao Zi can't get you, I will give birth to a child for you. I will be satisfied with your child by my side!"</p>
<p>Bai Yuanzhen and the others were stunned when they heard the words, and Bai Donglin's brows jumped, his expression a little stagnant.</p>
<p>"Sick! It's too sick!"</p>
<p>Weeping blood trembled and hummed softly, echoing and drifting in the quiet hall.</p>
<p>In the endless heavens, there are all kinds of strange things, what strange and strange things have Bai Donglin not seen before? What's more, this kind of pediatrics, it's just a matter of himself, so he was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>"All Worlds"</p>
<p>"no!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin frowned, he has no idea of ​​having children now, let alone Xiao Zi's unethical means.</p>
<p>"Without my permission, you will not succeed. Have you ever thought about why this child has not been born for hundreds of billions of years?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi's expression was stagnant, which really puzzled her for a long time. She tried her best to do everything she could, even her own practice was ranked behind, and she didn't find a solution. She just thought that Bai Donglin's strength was too strong, so It is so difficult to conceive an offspring.</p>
<p>"Why? Brother, you..."</p>
<p>"Xiao Zi, with my current state, everything, including the bloodline, has been brought to an end. Without my permission, there is no possibility of a child being born."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked helpless, nearly a trillion years, such a long time, because Xiao Zi missed him too much, his character had some distortions, and he made mistakes, he can understand, and he has to take all the responsibilities.</p>
<p>"Brother, I, I..."</p>
<p>Xiao Zi's mouth slumped, tears fell silently, and she almost cried out, looking at Bai Donglin pitifully.</p>
<p>"Little brother?"</p>
<p>Bai Yuanzhen had an unbearable look on her face. She was also a daughter. She understood Xiao Zi better and pleaded with her, but she didn't know how to speak. After all, this matter was indeed beyond her understanding.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, I'm all detached right now, and I don't have the heart to put my children's affections ahead of them."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin waved his hand with a determined look on his face. He also reflected on himself in his heart, why is his charm so great? I have tried my best to stay away, but I didn't expect these women to still miss him one by one.</p>
<p>"Ah? In other words, will Xiao Zi have a chance when you are detached, eldest brother?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi looked surprised, the pear blossom with rain, I felt pity.</p>
<p>"Humph! Don't even think about it!"</p>
<p>"Whoa whoa-"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi cried very loudly, and there is still the majesty of the Lord of the Temple. Fortunately, here are all my own people, so I don't have to worry about letting outsiders see the joke.</p>
<p>"When I capture Lianxin and others, and resolve the matter together, it will save you from fighting every day."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin ignored the crying Xiao Zi, reached out into the void, crossed the boundless distance, and uprooted the entire "Heart Palace". Many of the powerhouses were horrified and desperately resisted, but they were suppressed by a breath of breath and could not move.</p>
<p>rumbling—</p>
<p>The two forces that were incompatible with water and fire were forcibly merged together, and the Lord of the Heart Palace was also captured by Bai Donglin.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother! Are you back? Long time no see..."</p>
<p>With a cold expression and a heart full of great power ready to go, when he saw that the owner of his palm turned out to be Bai Donglin, his pretty face melted like an iceberg, and his eyes were full of surprise.</p>
<p>"Hahaha, Lianxin, you lost. As soon as the big brother comes back, he will come to see me first, and then to see you. What does this mean, do you still need me to say it?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi wiped away her tears, she would not lose her prestige in front of the enemy, and she would directly mock her loudly.</p>
<p>"Humph! I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>Lian Xin's expression sank, and she refused to admit it, but her hands were squeezed together nervously.</p>
<p>"Senior Sister Lianxin, why even you!?"</p>
<p>The corners of Bai Donglin's mouth twitched slightly, and his eyes fell on Lianxin's flat belly. Yes, it was his child again.</p>
<p>"Owner!"</p>
<p>The void was rippling, and a graceful figure appeared behind Lianxin, the white light was flowing, and the warm radiance filled the time and space.</p>
<p>Afterwards, two more figures appeared, one wearing a long emerald green dress, with nine-colored divine light lingering all over the body.</p>
<p>"Tianluo, Xiaolu, Jiuyao."</p>
<p>A hint of surprise flashed in Bai Donglin's eyes. When Tianluo and Xiaolu were in the only real world, in order to replace the world, they merged with Lianxin. What happened to this Chaos Demon God Jiuyao? He was not honest enough to devour the wreckage of the heavens for him, and he came here to make trouble!</p>
<p>"Master, don't blame Senior Sister Lianxin, it was my idea to conceive a heir for you, I only blame Bai Xiaozi for being too sloppy, wanting to kill first and then pay for it, the mother is more expensive than the child!"</p>
<p>"Bah! Bah! You're so rude!"</p>
<p>Xiao Zi jumped with anger, if it wasn't for Bai Donglin here, she would definitely go up and fight.</p>
<p>"Okay! Tianluo, where did you get my bloodline?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head helplessly, looking at the shy pity, he really didn't know what to say, hey, it's not good for a man to be too good, look, they are all scrambling to give him a baby.</p>
<p>"Master, have you forgotten?"</p>
<p>"We used to replace the world. You had a lot of flesh and blood scattered in the only real world. Under the cliff of Xiaohui Mountain, there are many life factors left. I extracted and preserved it."</p>
<p>For the strong, the corruption and dissipation of flesh and blood is not the end. Those decomposed particles can still be collected and reshaped.</p>
<p>"Okay! You guys are awesome!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin laughed in anger and gave a thumbs up. To a certain extent, the little life in the belly of the two women is really his heir. This thing is much more advanced than any cloned human being, although he has everything didn't do it!</p>
<p>Do you want to erase your own children with your own hands? For a while, Bai Donglin really felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Lianxin, what state are you in now? Four in one?"</p>
<p>I don't know how to deal with it, so I can only give it up for the time being. Anyway, without his permission, these two little guys can't be born. They can only stay in his mother's belly honestly. The strangeness of its state surprised him a little.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother, I got some opportunities in this world. The four-in-one is not completely correct, it should be the 'Four-phase One'!"</p>
<p>A chance here?</p>
<p>Could it be that it has something to do with the originating wheel of four colors?</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes narrowed slightly, and it was undoubtedly a great opportunity when it came to detached people. He didn't know much about this, and he didn't want to intervene too much. After all, each had his own way to go, so he could only nodded silently.</p>
<p>"Lian Xin, Xiao Zi, this is the end of your nonsense."</p>
<p>"Do you want to return to Baiyujing? Or continue to stay here?"</p>
<p>The idea of ​​cultivating the Way of Information in the Cangyue Heavens is indeed a good idea, but it is much worse than the strange place like the Land of Silence.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the two to respond, Bai Donglin stretched out his palm again and grabbed it in time and space, and one after another figure was detained.</p>
<p>Miracle, Qi Lifeng, Wandering Emperor, Cao Zhuo, Ban Xian, Lady White Bone, Poisonous Teeth Miaomiao...</p>
<p>All of the existences looked dazed and fell into the hall involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Yi! It's the Father God!"</p>
<p>Although Miracle was the youngest, his strength was the strongest. He was the first to regain his senses and threw himself into Bai Donglin's arms.</p>
<p>"Yi, God Father, Miracle misses you!"</p>
<p>The little head rubbed back and forth. The reason why she followed Xiao Zi was because Xiao Zi was bred from Bai Donglin's blood and blood, which made her very friendly, so she was fooled to this point and served as a coolie.</p>
<p>"I have seen Master!"</p>
<p>"grown ups!"</p>
<p>Seeing this group of familiar faces grow up, Bai Donglin couldn't help but feel happy with the power of the Eleventh Realm.</p>
<p>Bai Yujing's subordinate forces, the Ten Thousand Realms Pawnshop, are all over the heavens, providing them with endless resources and a supreme cultivation environment. It is reasonable and reasonable to be able to step into the eleven realms in nearly a trillion years.</p>
<p>Of course, not all people who came out of the only real world were all smooth sailing, and nearly 30% of them existed, disappeared forever, or failed to break through, or died of various disasters.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin is not a nanny either, so he can only blame them for not being able to. When the end comes, he will naturally not intervene.</p>
<p>"While I was away, I found a treasured place called the gray and quiet place..."</p>
<p>Come on, let's explain Bai Yujing's current situation in a few words, and let everyone make their own choices.</p>
<p>Looking at the contemplative crowd, Bai Donglin raised his brows, knowing what they were hesitating about, nothing more than the fact that they couldn't let go of the long years of business, and it was impossible to say that the arrangement of hundreds of millions of years had reached the critical moment of harvest, and the gray one. The land is too dangerous and full of unknowns.</p>
<p>Sharing the gray and lonely place is out of taking care of the old man. Bai Donglin didn't ask for any benefits, so he didn't ask for it, so he continued:</p>
<p>"The land of gray will open a channel to connect with the pawnshops of all worlds in the endless heavens. You don't have to worry about being isolated from gray."</p>
<p>"Hehe, I naturally know that these endless heavens, such as this Cangyue, have their merits, and nothing can be done behind closed doors."</p>
<p>"The gray and lonely place, let's just use it as your rear, a place of retreat, safety and practicality, it's still good."</p>
<p>The words have been said to this level, and everyone is not a fool. Knowing what to do, they all bowed their hands to Bai Donglin with gratitude.</p>
<p>"Thank you...!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded lightly, and then his thoughts moved, and the silent he and I avatars woke up in the **** shop.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's figure slightly imitated the lake for a moment, and in this moment, the means of freezing time and resurrection came together, and the "pregnant gods and casting demons" were completed for all his and me clones, and the number of **** shops exploded again. increase.</p>
<p>Moreover, he left behind a special vortex power, which is connected to the gray and lonely place, and even if he does not personally take action, he can still travel through it.</p>
<p>It can be said that countless heavens are connected by the Ten Thousand Realms Pawnshop, and the gray and quiet place is a transportation hub.</p>
<p>After arranging everything, Bai Donglin didn't stay any longer, and he didn't bother about his bloodline children anymore. He took Bai Yuanzhen and left Cangyue Zhutian.</p>
<p>"Little brother, think about it carefully. I think those two women are very good. Anyway, you have to leave incense for the Bai family, right?"</p>
<p>Bai Yuanzhen had a smile in her eyes, a little joking, but she still had some sincere feelings. Obviously, she really meant it.</p>
<p>"Stop!"</p>
<p>"Sister, don't talk about me, haven't you solved your own life-long affairs?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Bai Yuanzhen's face showed a look of embarrassment, and quickly shut up, pretending to be dumb.</p>
<p>"Besides, isn't there a big brother to continue the incense of the Bai family? Trillions of years have passed, I estimate..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin froze for a while, turned his hand to take out the weeping blood, flicked his fingers, and said in a condensed voice, "Weeping blood, you haven't explained where my eldest brother went, are you hiding something?"</p>
<p>clang--</p>
<p>"Hey! It hurts! I said, I'll say it!"</p>
<p>"Master, this is a long story. Hundreds of billions of years ago, Liu Yiyi was about to break through the eleventh realm, but when the timeline was closed, an accident occurred and he died."</p>
<p>"Huh? Sister-in-law is dead?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin frowned, he didn't expect to hear this bad news, hey, the journey of cultivation is full of disasters, and no one can guarantee where he will stop.</p>
<p>Moreover, Liu Yiyi told the truth that her talent is really average. It can be said that among the first batch of creatures who stepped out of the only real world, they belonged to the bottom, and it was entirely because of Bai Jiange that they were selected.</p>
<p>When Bai Donglin recast Liu Yiyi's body, he also specially raised his qualifications, but there is one thing, the characteristics of the id consciousness are not his ability to do things.</p>
<p>His consciousness is special, all because of the transformation of the seven-color divine light. It is conceivable that the mystery of the restricted area of ​​consciousness cannot be touched by ordinary means.</p>
<p>"Hey, Liu Yiyi is too impatient, master~www.mtlnovel.com~ I guess, she may not want to drag your elder brother back, after all, at that time, Lord Jiange had already reached the end of the eleventh realm. We need to look for opportunities on the other side.”</p>
<p>"Although I don't want to say that, but Liu Yiyi's aptitude is a little short, and he will fail to break through. There is a certainty in it."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin couldn't help but nodded when he heard the words, and most of the speculations of crying blood were inseparable. It was indeed a bit troublesome to die because of the closing of the timeline, but it was not difficult for the other side to exist.</p>
<p>"Master, Lord Jiange said when he left that when he breaks through to the other side, he will come back to resurrect Liu Yiyi, don't bother you to take action."</p>
<p>"alright, I got it."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head and laughed, and understood what the second brother meant. He wanted to revive his beloved wife as a belief, to break the boat and get a glimpse of the other side.</p>
<p>"By the way, there is one more thing!"</p>
<p>Weeping blood was startled, and his tone became a little strange, as if hesitating whether to say it or not.</p>
<p>"What are you chirping? Tell me."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin raised his brows slightly, and didn't use his supernatural powers to observe everything. Sometimes, omniscience and omnipotence would be boring and uninteresting. This kind of feeling full of "people" should be cherished.</p>
<p>"Cough, Empress Yuanzhen, aren't you worried that the Bai family will break the incense?"</p>
<p>"It's not necessary!"</p>
<p>"Lord Jiange has left a pair of heirs. After hundreds of billions of years of reproduction, the blood of the Bai family has been countless, and even occupied a huge universe."</p>
<p>"but……"</p>
<p>"Their reputation is not very good!"</p>
<p>Not only is it not good, it is simply notorious, weeping blood secretly in my heart, but dare not say it.</p>
<p>After all, it doesn't know what attitude its master has towards the blood of the Bai family.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes narrowed slightly, as if he had guessed something, a look of indifference flashed across his face.</p>
