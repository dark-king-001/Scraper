<p>boom! Kacha —</p>
<p>He raised his palm and slapped it fiercely, and the power of the concept of infinite eddy current surged out. In an instant, dense platinum cracks spread, and the terrifying **** hands with hundreds of super-thoughts trembled and collapsed, turning into nothingness, falling into Fantasy sea.</p>
<p>With only one hand to resolve the crisis, Bai Donglin did not relax his vigilance. After a moment of concentration, he breathed a sigh of relief, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"As expected of the second emperor of the wild leaves, he is really powerful!"</p>
<p>He broke through the means of Heiyuan and rescued the ruthless. With the ubiquitous characteristics of the detached, the opponent did not come, and there was no follow-up attack. Obviously, Huang Tiandi and the two completely suppressed Heiyuan, making it completely impossible to interfere with the outside world.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>As the blood of detachment left by Heiyuan dissipated, the ancient stone monument returned to its original appearance and became the most ordinary rock.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my fellow Daoist, for helping me."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin heard the sound and looked back, only to see a woman in a white dress wearing a bronze mask, who had walked out of the depths of the corpse continent. Every step she took, her aura became stronger and stronger. The invisible and bizarre qi movement stirred the boundless sea of ​​fantasy. , Such terrifying power is not as simple as the other side.</p>
<p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment, allow me to deal with some trivial matters."</p>
<p>"Um?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin had doubts in his eyes, and he was trapped for endless years. At this time, he was out of the cage. He should return as soon as possible to see the wild leaves. What could be more important than this?</p>
<p>"Prove eternity, step on detachment!"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, the eyes of the Ruthless Great Emperor were full of brilliance, and behind him there appeared crystal wheels of light, layer upon layer, endless. It was vaguely visible that there were figures standing there. Although they were like lakes, they could clearly perceive the same meaning. They are all the body of a ruthless man himself.</p>
<p>what! ?</p>
<p>The corners of Bai Donglin's brows trembled slightly, and he was careless. He thought that he had become detached in an instant, and the force was already full.</p>
<p>Good little trivia!</p>
<p>Damn, why didn't he think of this trick in the first place? Bai Donglin was secretly annoyed, clapped his hands on his thighs, and sighed.</p>
<p>The ruthless man is not joking. As a person who has come here, he has already sensed the same kind of breath on the other side, and an eternal consciousness is slowly awakening.</p>
<p>呲!</p>
<p>Under the tearing of the ruthless man, the void cracked a pitch-black gap, and a black stone jar shot out from it, and fell firmly into the hands of the ruthless man, like a bottomless black hole, even the eyes can be swallowed up.</p>
<p>"Huh? This is..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin looked at it intently, and was stunned for a moment. He saw a big "Chu" character on the tank. The dragon was flying and the phoenix danced, and the breath was weird, like a living thing.</p>
<p>"Hey, funny, it's that guy."</p>
<p>"Perfect heavens, perfect heavens, what's so strange about you!? Actually..."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes closed slightly, his eyes flickered uncertainly, his infinite thoughts spread out, all kinds of information were gathered and deduced, and when he was thinking, he stood on the spot, which can be regarded as protecting the way for the ruthless.</p>
<p>During this period of time, there have been entanglements between the various forces within the ten thousand clans, as well as the black disaster, and there is a faint sign of catastrophe.</p>
<p>In troubled times, there will be heroes. The most dangerous era is also the most splendid era.</p>
<p>First there is Bai Donglin, then there is the Ruthless Great Emperor, it is reasonable to have a few detached ones, but...</p>
<p>The Perfect Heavens are indeed a bit illegal!</p>
<p>First, there was the Two Heavenly Emperors of the Wild Leaves, which was already unique among the endless heavens, and now there is the Ruthless Man, and the strange stone jar that has lost its human form.</p>
<p>It's not an exaggeration to call it a heaven-defying one.</p>
<p>"It seems that the problem is still on the blue star of the source point. When I get back what Xiaoyuan left behind, I should be able to understand the reason."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin thought of his own experience in the perfect heavens. He once passed the Time and Space Administration and retraced the so-called ancient road of detachment.</p>
<p>One of the stops about Ye Tiandi, but above the Blue Star Taishan, the source point Blue Star, what is that place?</p>
<p>In other heavens, the origin universe where Blue Star is located is hidden in the highest dimension, cannot be seen from the other side, and has the protection of the Origin Lord, except for Origin Walkers, only the transcendental ones have the ability to step in. Among them.</p>
<p>But the source point universe of the perfect heavens has been completely exposed, and even Blue Star has become a "tourist attraction". In the legend, that universe is a world of time and space cut down by the Emperor Huang Tian. Now that I think about it, things are probably not that simple.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! My lord—"</p>
<p>The shattering of the stone stele and the coming out of the ruthless man made the idiot lord suddenly understand everything. Facing the terrifying aura of the transcendence, his heart was ashes and his expression was miserable.</p>
<p>"Hehe, let's do it, it's not a loss at all to die under the hands of the detached."</p>
<p>Chi Tongzhen took the initiative, got up slowly, and faced death with a body that had knelt down for endless years.</p>
<p>"die?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin pressed his thoughts down, looked down indifferently, and a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth. This old guy had a "killing revenge" against him, and he deserved to die, but it was too cheap for him to die like this.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that it is too wasteful. Every other shore is an extremely cherished existence. Whether it is Wanzu or Black Calamity, after all, it is the supreme powerhouse second only to the detached, and it is only the heavens that are naturally conceived. Only the indigenous people of the world can achieve the other side.</p>
<p>It would be a pity to kill him. If it was before, he didn't know how to deal with it, but after achieving detachment, there are much more methods.</p>
<p>"You are just a small other side, even if you swallow you, it is not very useful to me today, but well, your consciousness of the eight realms has some value."</p>
<p>Hearing Bai Donglin's faint words, God Chi Tong trembled in his heart, and he felt that something was worse than death waiting for him.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the idiot-like God's expression turned ruthless, his thoughts self-destructed, and together with his conscious body, it all turned into nothingness.</p>
<p>"You too underestimate the transcendence, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I, I, how could..."</p>
<p>The idiot God looked sluggish, looking at himself in perfect condition, his consciousness suddenly fell for a while, as if the self-destruction just now was just a mirror, but the intention of death was so vivid in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Come on, from now on, you will be a part of my huge energy pool, hum! If you don't squeeze you dry, won't it ruin my reputation for being diligent and thrifty?"</p>
<p>Raising his hand and waving, the terrified idiot God turned with the wind, leaving behind only a dazzling ball of light, which is the crystallization of the consciousness of the eight realms, the most crucial characteristic of which was preserved by Bai Donglin, always At the moment, they are doing their best to create something out of nothing, a thought is a big thousand!</p>
<p>Bai Donglin has already made up his mind, and the other side that falls into his hands in the future will be the same fate, neither life nor death, like an inexhaustible battery, which will always supply him with energy and make the best use of waste.</p>
<p>The "Pregnant God Casting Demons" has no end to it. The stronger the infinite heavens, the stronger the power of the vortex, which is the key to his ability to suppress the transcendence such as the snake mother.</p>
<p>呲! rumbling—</p>
<p>Suddenly, endless colorful thunder appeared in the void, the boundless sea of ​​fantasy trembled violently, and the illusory waves were turbulent, seemingly unbearable.</p>
<p>The Ruthless Emperor has restrained all the miraculous, suddenly ordinary, and suddenly detached from everything, the eternal true meaning lingers around his body, his breath is extremely strong, and the black stone jar held in his hand is also dyed with a dreamy color, vaguely. There seemed to be laughter whizzing past.</p>
<p>'Awesome, she really succeeded. With such a unique method, it seems that before she was captured by Heiyuan, she was not far from a breakthrough. ’</p>
<p>Every transcendence person is not something that can be accomplished simply, and they have all gone through countless hardships, endless suffering, and boundless years. Perhaps this black source is the last calamity for the ruthless person to set foot on the transcendence.</p>
<p>"Thank you buddy!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin nodded slightly, received this salute, one life-saving and two road protection, this kind of grace and affection, well-deserved.</p>
<p>"Fellow Daoist, congratulations, congratulations, but now the situation is dangerous, I am afraid that the detachment can only be postponed temporarily."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>Ruthless people's eyes narrowed. Since Heiyuan had already taken action on her, the biggest bargaining chip, it was obvious that the situation had reached the most severe moment. Otherwise, the two of them would definitely not give up on her and choose to confront Heiyuan head-on.</p>
<p>"Are you going? Rationally, I think you should stabilize your realm now and don't get involved in the battlefield for the time being."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's words are true, the ruthless man is not like him, he is a real new detachment, and the traces of existence he spread are probably only limited to the perfect heavens.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no immortality talent, facing those terrifying guys, there is a high chance of falling.</p>
<p>He is different, even the snake mother was shocked by his specialness at first, and the blessing of the eddy current is too strong. The key is that I have never heard of a new transcendence, who can keep up with the narrative-level traces everywhere. circulation.</p>
<p>All this also stems from Bai Donglin's previous operations.</p>
<p>When he was in the heavens, he used the will of the observer to spread countless avatars in the endless heavens, and for each subsequent dao, those avatars were drawn in the same way.</p>
<p>It can be said that there is his avatar in every side of the heavens now, operating the pawnshop of all realms, selling the energy contained in his consciousness, and further deepening the spread of traces.</p>
<p>The original intention at that time was just to plunder the energy, but he never wanted to inadvertently add to the willows and willows, which led to the new detachment of him. The number of traces is not weaker than those of the old detached ones, or even more. Compared with them, he is worse. It's just a concept.</p>
<p>For this, Bai Donglin already has a solution, and he will be able to erase this defect soon.</p>
<p>"Fellow Daoist, we should be going, don't worry, we are not as weak as you think."</p>
<p>The ruthless man's tone was calm, but he contained strong self-confidence. The stone jar in his hand shook slightly, and a strong will was emitted.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin hesitated a little, thinking about the special features of the perfect heavens, and the strength of the two people who joined forces to make the heroes jealous, and couldn't help but imagine again and again, if these two join...</p>
<p>"it is good!"</p>
<p>"In that case, two fellow Daoists, please enter into extinction!"</p>
<p>It is not so easy to enter the source point tomb world. Even if it is a detached person, the snake mother can walk out of death again and again, but it is not from the outside world. It is because she has left traces of existence in the tomb world in advance.</p>
<p>From the inside, it can penetrate the endless heavens of the ages, but it is unbreakable from the outside. This is the strange tomb world created by the master of the source point.</p>
<p>If Bai Donglin wanted to re-enter at this time, he had to rely on the traces left in advance, and if he wanted to bring Ruthless and the others, he could only rely on immortality.</p>
<p>The method is very simple, the same as when Bai Jiange and others were brought out from the cage of Zhige Zhutian.</p>
<p>A detached person can be reborn with a trace of it, and it is much more convenient without him to reconstruct his existence.</p>
<p>"In this way, it will trouble fellow Daoists."</p>
<p>Although I don't know what Bai Donglin is going to do, Ruthless still has trust in the benefactor of life. Taking ten thousand steps back, it's just one death. She is now an eternal transcendence!</p>
<p>"Destroy-"</p>
<p>The two of them had a jar, and they self-destructed at the same time. Bai Donglin wrapped the traces of the self-consciousness of the ruthless man and the stone jar with the will of the observer, and anchored the source point tomb world between the thoughts.</p>
<p>Chicken thieves like him, long before stepping on the altar to accept the test, have left many clones that maintain a state of self-destruction, and it is easy to use them to cross.</p>
<p>From this point of view, immortality and immortality are still very advantageous. God knows how much effort those detached people have spent in order to enter the tomb world.</p>
<p>The so-called traces of existence are essentially the extension of the concept of the eternal and immortal self-consciousness of the detached person, which contains the true meaning of immortality, so that the detached person can completely reverse life and death, which is incomparable against the sky.</p>
<p>Regarding the existence of traces, one of the most critical points is that there can be no traces left between the detached people, and it is impossible for two detached people to get stuck in a bug.</p>
<p>Just like "Zhan", obviously many detached people still remember him, but he can't be resurrected from his memory, even if Zhan is not completely self-destructed in order to block Zhige Zhutian, this is still the case.</p>
<p>The ultimate reason is that the transcendental person's eternal and immortal consciousness has the characteristics of being pure and incorruptible, and it will actively reject or even directly destroy the immortal true meaning from outside.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ruthless man and the stone jar could not get out of the memory of the two people, but they could only rely on Bai Donglin to bring them into the source point tomb world.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"die-"</p>
<p>The lightly falling palm became the center of heaven and earth, and the concept of infinity was overwhelmed. All the detached people couldn't help but set their eyes on it, and their hearts were chilled. This was a terrifying force that vaguely surpassed detachment.</p>
<p>Incomprehensible, indescribable, and capable of surpassing the cognition of the transcendence, there is no doubt that it must be the legendary power.</p>
<p>logic! logic!</p>
<p>Invincible! Invincible!</p>
<p>The consciousness of all the detached people is screaming.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the rumors were true, and the two of them could really touch the ultimate state of supremacy temporarily.</p>
<p>Is this the most terrifying killer in the human race?</p>
<p>"Huang! Ye! You can't kill me, you can't kill me! I, have the protection of Father God..."</p>
<p>Heiyuan faced this palm directly, and the pressure he endured far surpassed that of others. His body was faintly cracked, and the concept that lingered on his body disappeared silently. His expression became hideous and terrifying.</p>
<p>This time, she was the one who smashed it. She didn't expect that the wild leaves would directly lift the table, but she couldn't die. She believed that the Father would not abandon her. too much.</p>
<p>The only regret is that this trip lost the opportunity to peep the secret of the source point, and also released the beast of wild leaves.</p>
<p>"Humph! Whether you can kill or not, you have to kill to know."</p>
<p>It's a long story. For the detached person who is not contaminated with the concept of time, the speed is no longer divided into fast and slow.</p>
<p>Knowing the horror of Ye Ye's alliance, Heiyuan never thought of resisting, and he went to death calmly. At the last moment of dissipating his existence, his expression suddenly changed, becoming extremely ugly, as if he had eaten a bucket of feces.</p>
<p>"Damn!"</p>
<p>"White! East! Pro!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>If he lost, he lost the game completely. Heiyuan's roar and the concept of existence dissipated in the tomb world at the same time, and the many traces left secretly before were also destroyed by a strange force.</p>
<p>"Humph!"</p>
<p>The two of them frowned at the same time, and a trace of unwillingness flashed on their faces. They could feel that the palm of their hand just now directly wiped out 99% of the traces of Heiyuan's existence.</p>
<p>But at the last moment of obliterating Heiyuan, when the power extended to its core, a terrifying power suddenly emerged, annihilating their power.</p>
<p>The black light at the beginning of the source, really did not die, as terrible as the legend, beheaded the invincible existence of the master of the source point.</p>
<p>"Cough cough, could it be that the ruthless died in vain? No!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Ye Tiandi looked resentful, there was faint blood on the corner of his mouth, and the black hole behind him showed signs of dissipating. Obviously, this state is extremely difficult to maintain, and the cost is not small.</p>
<p>"kill-"</p>
<p>Feeling Ye Ye's anger, Huang Tiandi sighed in his heart, then took out his palm again and pressed it on the head of another black disaster detachment.</p>
<p>"Do not!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>This guy is only at the conceptual level, and he does not have the backing of such a powerful Father God as Primordial Black Light. Under such a terrifying attack, it is natural that he cannot escape death, and all traces of existence are directly obliterated. , completely dissipated.</p>
<p>Even his closest relatives will completely forget them, and his bloodline descendants will disappear into the obliteration of the concept of cause and effect.</p>
<p>"Cough-cough-"</p>
<p>After successive shots, the barren leaves have reached the limit, and the seven orifices are all pouring out the blood of scorching detachment.</p>
<p>It can cause detached people to have irreversible injuries. It can be seen that although this kill is terrifying, it is not a conventional method that can be used casually.</p>
<p>It should be so, otherwise, the human race would have already relied on the power of the barren leaves to quell the black disaster. After all, before, everyone did not know that the original black light was not dead.</p>
<p>The existence of the barren leaves is more like a "nuclear deterrent". Sometimes it is not used, and it may be more beneficial to the human race. Once it is used, it will often hurt both the enemy and us.</p>
<p>call-</p>
<p>Seeing that the wild leaves returned to normal, and the breath was even weaker, the alien detachment who had been frightened, all breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>They are not afraid of being laughed at when they say it. Just now, they had even retreated and were about to give up the secret of the source point, but now, the scale of victory seems to be tilted in their favor again.</p>
<p>Both the human race and the black disaster suffered, and they were the biggest winners!</p>
<p>"Giggle! Wonderful, really wonderful!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>At first, the snake mother, the positive and negative things, walks from nothingness. Although she looks like a victory, she is far away from the two barren leaves. Obviously, she still has more seasons in her heart, for fear of falling into the footsteps of those who escape from the black disaster. .</p>
<p>"You guys, want to try it too?"</p>
<p>Huang Tiandi's eyes are cold and stern, he is not intimidating, if he let go of everything, with the determination to give up his life, it is not difficult to kill all these alien races.</p>
<p>However, there are still primordial black light waiting for them outside UU Reading www.uukanshu.com, so they can't use all their power here.</p>
<p>"Uh-"</p>
<p>For a while, the tomb world fell into silence, and neither side dared to move lightly.</p>
<p>呲!</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were some ripples in the void, and under the watchful eyes of the detached people, Bai Donglin Shi Shiran stepped out of it with a bright smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Tsk, it's a pity, I seem to be a step late and missed the most exciting part."</p>
<p>The Ruthless Emperor, holding a stone jar in his hand, slowly walked out of the traces of consciousness. His peerless elegance instantly illuminated the entire source point tomb world.</p>
<p>"ruthless man..."</p>
<p>Ye Tiandi blinked, stunned for a moment, and then looked at Huang Tiandi.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!"</p>
<p>"well!</p>
<p>"</p>
