<p>''Everything outside of me is destroyed. ''</p>
<p>At the beginning, the black light was inexplicably furious. As soon as he thought about it, he vomited and killed. For the first time, he used the power of terrifying logic obtained after the fusion of the black light.</p>
<p>Bearing the brunt of the brunt, all the detached people around were horrified, and then their consciousness and real body disappeared, turning into a bunch of illusory fireworks.</p>
<p>That was cut in half by "White Tomorrow", there is still the black disaster and the vortex of the endless dead and silent heavens, and the countless black disaster creatures left behind, abstractly distorted, as if cleaned by rubber sassafras, boundless airspace There is only darkness and nothingness left.</p>
<p>The vortex of the black heavens is gone.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>In the place where all races and souls are born, the whirlpool of the white heavens followed closely, and it was only a little bit late, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Even if it was a desolate place with "Logical Ten Directions Shelter", it only lasted for a moment, and it was also annihilated.</p>
<p>In a single thought, a word was spoken, and the infinitely huge vortex of the heavens on both sides was completely erased. In this situation, the horror has exceeded the limit of the imagination of life.</p>
<p>This is the power of complete logic, the vastness of its power, and all resistance seems weak and meaningless.</p>
<p>Snapped! clap clap!</p>
<p>"Not bad, black light, it really is a very powerful force."</p>
<p>With a smile in his eyes, Bai Donglin stood in the endless nothingness, staring at the original black light from a distance. He was not damaged in the strange attack just now. With a light stroke of his palm, not only did he not care about the tragic situation in front of him, but he seemed satisfied. nodded.</p>
<p>Also possessing the power of complete logic, naturally, he saw through the means by which the primordial black light destroyed the world.</p>
<p>It's very simple, the original black light, the first transcendence of the black disaster, naturally left countless traces of existence all over the world, many of which are biographies with her as the protagonist, writing about her power and praising her supreme glory. .</p>
<p>Every detached person has the same things, and Bai Donglin is no exception. For example, one of them is called "The Immortal Me...".</p>
<p>But just now, Primordial Black Light tampered with the logic and turned a biography of her into "real", while the black and white endless vortex of heavens that should have been real turned into an illusory world in the biography, It became a fantasy of a little guy.</p>
<p>With the thought of the original black light, the little guy swiped his pen and wrote the words "things outside me, everything will be destroyed", the fantasy immediately became a reality, and he easily completed the feat of destroying the world.</p>
<p>This trick is similar to the use of "narrative power", but it becomes extremely terrifying due to the blessing of logic. Even the detached cannot avoid it. Yuanyuan Black Light will come up with this attack method, and it is also at the narrative level with her all the year round. Just stepping into the logic is not too familiar with its own strength.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Of course, the external objects destroyed by this world do not naturally include Bai Donglin, who is protected by the logical white light, and the endless source blue star that is the core of control.</p>
<p>The reason why Bai Donglin is happy is because the original black light is indeed a fusion of black light, which controls the power of complete logic and completes the mission of the buffer tool.</p>
<p>"Humph! Black light?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha, good, what a Bai Donglin!"</p>
<p>At the beginning, Heiguang laughed in anger, but now, after her annihilation, the guy in front of her still looked down on her so much that he didn't take her seriously, and even called her "Black Light"!</p>
<p>Did you notice it?</p>
<p>Hey, this Primordial Black Light is still a bit brainy, not too stupid.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's heart moved, subject to the isolation of the black light's logic, he could not see through the conscious thinking of the original black light, but he also guessed why the original black light was so angry.</p>
<p>"Original Black Light, although you understand something, it's a pity that it's too late."</p>
<p>"Well, that's true, what's the difference if you understand or don't understand? There is no primordial black light, and there are other cats and dogs. There must always be a black disaster to integrate the logical black light and become a buffer tool for me to swallow the black light. , all resistance is meaningless and futile."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's expression was sullen, and he slowly stated the facts, but it was extremely harsh when he heard it in the black light at the beginning.</p>
<p>"Human Race, I have to admit that your calculations really blinded me, but so what!?"</p>
<p>"You are so confident!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"You absolutely shouldn't, you shouldn't let me successfully integrate the black light. At this moment, we all have the power of logic. It's too early to say who wins and who loses!"</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>At the thought of the original black light, he immediately transformed the rolling negative emotions into fiery fighting intent, making him always in a perfect state of peak combat power.</p>
<p>She understood that as soon as Bai Donglin appeared, she realized that she had been living on the chessboard of others after realizing that the master of the source point was his son and that he also controlled the power of logic.</p>
<p>How powerful is the thinking of the logical controller?</p>
<p>Even if there are only a few clues, the slightest strangeness, based on this illogical anomaly, all kinds of possibilities are immediately deduced, and in the midst of all uncertainties, the facts that are closest to the truth are instantly locked.</p>
<p>It was calculated, so what?</p>
<p>As Yuan Chu Heiguang said, she is not self-comfort, but she who controls the logical black light, has the confidence to defeat Bai Donglin at the same level.</p>
<p>Moreover, he has already begun to think about how to plunder the power of logic in the other party and take himself to a higher level. It can be said that he is full of self-confidence.</p>
<p>"I'm too confident? No, this sentence should be given to you."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shook his head gently, his eyes showed a strange look, no wonder he couldn't see the black light of the beginning of the original, without his arrangement in advance, the black light of the beginning of the original could not be merged with the black light of logic, and he would have died completely under the impact of endless negative logic. .</p>
<p>Regarding how to integrate black and white divine light, he was too careless at first, until after he controlled the source point and understood the power of logic white light, he realized that if he wanted to control logic, he needed id consciousness to transcend eternal transformation.</p>
<p>Don't think too much, the self in a certain life must have left the arrangement ahead of time. With the help of Huangtian Emperor, he cut down the sword of "White Tomorrow" and sent the opportunity of transforming consciousness to the mouth of Primordial Black Light.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin can perceive that the breath that is closely connected with him has been integrated with the consciousness of the original black light, regardless of you and me.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>'There is a back door, the original black light, how can you fight me? ’</p>
<p>Pressing down his thoughts, Bai Donglin's eyes became serious. His real enemy was the seven-color divine light in his consciousness. The original black light was nothing but a clown, so there was no need to delay her.</p>
<p>"Time and space, now!"</p>
<p>Reach out a little, and the endless nothingness ripples into layers. The sacred timeline that was completely wiped out by the original black light was re-fabricated by Bai Donglin with the power of logic.</p>
<p>When the dazzling golden light spread to the boundless edge, Bai Donglin stepped out and returned to the past. Before destroying the world, he waved his palm and captured the whirlpool of the heavens and all the detached people who died in the palm of his hand, and then Pacing back into reality.</p>
<p>As for the vortex of the black catastrophe, it will be gone without it, don't say hand in hand, even if the original black light does not "righteously kill relatives", he will do it himself afterwards, and without the black light, the black catastrophe has lost the foundation of existence and will be extinct. But it's a matter of time.</p>
<p>As Bai Donglin came to the world, those invisible sources were actively lasing and attached to the heavens that belonged to them.</p>
<p>The source blue stars are shrouded in logic, and they are absolutely unique above time and space. Without Bai Donglin's indication, they did not return to the newly born past time and space.</p>
<p>"Useless emotions will only be your constraints!"</p>
<p>Yuan Chu Heiguang watched coldly and did not stop Bai Donglin. She even preferred the other party to do so. The so-called righteousness of the ethnic group was nothing but a hindrance, and it might be the key to her victory.</p>
<p>"Hehe, you don't understand."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin flipped his palm and turned the vortex of the heavens into his mind, becoming an indelible memory. There is no place that is safer than his thinking time and space.</p>
<p>boom-</p>
<p>The two sides stopped talking, looked at each other with cold words, and the endless terrifying atmosphere rushed toward him. In an instant, the boundless and empty domain was divided into two, one side was pure white, the other was dark, and the difference was clear.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Time and space disappear, there is no past, and there is no future, everything collapses to where the two are in the form of logic.</p>
<p>"Destroy it!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>I saw that the original black light flickered, and immediately jumped out of the domain of nothingness. It was extremely illogical, and in the "nothingness" that should not exist, it forced the creation of a higher-level domain time and space.</p>
<p>The original black light stood in Xintiandi, with a huge and boundless body, and his palms were slowly spread out. The palms clenched tightly.</p>
<p>"Logical Hole—"</p>
<p>呲!</p>
<p>One side is indescribable, filled with emptiness with twisted and disordered logical lines, suddenly emerges, and directly swallows the realm of emptiness in one mouthful, faintly heard a crisp and delicate chewing sound.</p>
<p>"Dare to swallow anything? Hmph! I'm not afraid of eating a bad stomach!"</p>
<p>Rolling thunder sounds surging out of the seven orifices of the original black light. The invisible ripples, full of logic power, smashed the entire domain into pieces, making it unbearable to exist.</p>
<p>The body was almost smashed into mud from the inside out, but the original black light still had a calm face, and he raised his sword fingers unhurriedly. eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Poisonous Logic Worm!"</p>
<p>"Swallow! Assimilate into one!"</p>
<p>Endless negativity, extreme evil thoughts, will completely pollute Bai Donglin's consciousness, swallow its existence, and naturalize logic into one.</p>
<p>"Earlier than me? Hahaha, whatever, it's as you wish!"</p>
<p>Aware of the motive of the original black light, Bai Donglin couldn't help but smile, but I have to say that this old thing is quite smart, and understands that the logic controller cannot be wiped out by conventional means, and the only way to go is to swallow and assimilate.</p>
<p>With my fragility, attack your fragility.</p>
<p>The battle of id consciousness is nothing more than this!</p>
<p>"Human, how can your emotional consciousness be compared to the infinite pure negative evil?"</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"As long as there is a trace of malicious thoughts, you are not you, I will be you!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"You want to devour me? That's malice! Die-"</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the black light, he sat down, pinched the strange seal in his hand, his eyes shot out an infinitely high column of jet-black light, and the invisible flame lingered around the majestic body.</p>
<p>"Huh!? This, this is..."</p>
<p>It turned into a dark sea of ​​light, and the original black light that enveloped Bai Donglin in a circle, before he could swallow it, he noticed the strangeness in his consciousness, and suddenly froze in place with a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>"Original Black Light, from the beginning, you lost."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's expression was indifferent, standing in the endless darkness. Terrible negative logic continued to wash over his consciousness, but he was isolated by a layer of radiance.</p>
<p>At the same time, a little bit of gorgeous seven-color radiance slowly emerged, covering Bai Donglin, his expression was indescribable, and the mysterious fluctuation of consciousness was not in the category of eternity.</p>
<p>"Impossible! It's impossible!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>The original black light self-consciousness fell into a short-lived blank, the form was forcibly gathered, the dark sea of ​​light returned to its true form, and a little bit of seven-color light flowed out from its eyebrows and quickly spread to the whole body.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!</p>
<p>Ridiculous, ridiculous! "</p>
<p>"I, it turns out that I was already dead!"</p>
<p>In the beginning, Heiguang laughed wildly in the sky, showing the sadness and unwillingness of the heroic ending. She tried all her means, but she could not reverse the process of assimilation of consciousness.</p>
<p>Logic, although she can use the power of logic to tamper with everything, she cannot distort the fact that the breakthrough and transformation of her id consciousness was successfully completed under the impetus of the seven-colored brilliance.</p>
<p>If it is tampered with, although it can be logically forcibly established, the consequence is that her consciousness will fall to the eternal and immortal realm, and she will lose the qualification to control logic, which is also a dead end.</p>

She cannot tamper with its ownership due to its protection.</p>
<p>Logic can only be defeated by logic.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Hei Guangming realized everything, and gradually stopped laughing, and the unwillingness in her eyes also dissipated. She was completely defeated.</p>
<p>But then again, it's no wonder that Bai Donglin is insidious. Without this "secret hand", she would not have the possibility of merging with black light, so Yuan Chu Heiguang said that she had already died, and died on the way of merging with black light. .</p>
<p>It's not wrong to lose, but it's convincing.</p>
<p>"How did you do it?"</p>
<p>The source of black light asked in a deep voice, the seven-color radiance has covered most of her consciousness body, the self is about to dissipate, but there is a lot of curiosity in her heart.</p>
<p>"Um?"</p>
<p>"Are you talking about a breakthrough in id consciousness?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin understands Yuanchu Heiguang's thoughts at this moment. At this time, it doesn't matter, there is just nowhere to show off, and it's not a big problem to talk about it.</p>
<p>After all, this original black light, for his big plan, "voluntarily" dedicated his life, endured loneliness in the time and space of the stone monument, and retreated for endless years.</p>
<p>"You may not believe it. In the process of controlling the source point, I merged with all things, and everything in the endless heavens, every grass and tree, every sand and dust, once existed as the carrier of my consciousness."</p>
<p>"In this mysterious state, I have been immersed in 130,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 thousand trillion years of years, oh, of course, in some low-dimensional space-time, small world, the time flow rate is different, on the time scale, it probably needs to be multiplied by countless times. "</p>
<p>"It's like this, I don't know how long it took, when I woke up, my consciousness was very different, and I entered a realm where I couldn't tell the truth, and it was mysterious and mysterious, even I couldn't explain it myself."</p>

<p>Beyond eternity, the end of consciousness, the realm of nothingness!</p>
<p>After listening, Yuanyuan Black Light fell into a long silence, and only the limbs were left in the seven-colored brilliance.</p>
<p>"That's it?"</p>
<p>"That's it!"</p>
<p>"Just based on those ridiculous things? Endless years?! This, how is this possible..."</p>
<p>In the murmur, Yuan Chu Black Light's voice gradually became low and inaudible. Even if his heart was full of disbelief, but he was about to disappear completely, what reason did Bai Donglin lie to her?</p>
<p>"I know that in the beginning of your life, Black Light, your eyes are only on logic. Days and nights are thinking about how to integrate the black light, and you don't look down on things like the endless heavens that can be destroyed at your fingertips."</p>
<p>"But you have ever thought that the origin of all things in the universe is not from the divine light of logic? Although it is fragile, it is not ordinary. One is complex and the other is simple. It is the acme of two different directions. In a way, the value is equal!"</p>
<p>"Why can't it contain infinite power?"</p>
<p>All living beings, the self-consciousness, is the most splendid creation of the heavens, and the fertile soil for the growth of consciousness is naturally among the heavens and the myriad things.</p>
<p>"Looking up at the stars all the time, won't your neck be sore? Remember to keep your head down and look at the flowers and plants around you. Although they are not as dazzling as the stars, they are within reach, real, and even with the fragrance of plants and trees."</p>
<p>"Bow your head, fragrance..."</p>
<p>At the beginning, the corners of Heiguang's mouth moved slightly, and he whispered in a low voice. The voice of Bai Donglin was still in his ears, and then it became fainter and more distant, until it disappeared. , I completely dissipated.</p>
<p>The original black light died, leaving behind the body, the consciousness in a strange state, and the terrifying logical black light.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>"Finally, everything is ready, seven colors of light? It's time to get rid of this time bomb."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes narrowed slightly, and his mood was extremely complicated. There were excitement, anticipation, and a little nervousness. He did not choose to cut off these so-called distracting thoughts, but to savor them carefully. honeydew.</p>
<p>This human emotion, which was regarded as a weakness by the original black light, is something that Bai Donglin never wants to throw away. With them, it is meaningful to live, otherwise, how is it different from a dead thing?</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's thoughts filled his mind, he had already stepped forward, slowly stretched out his fingers, and lightly tapped on the eyebrows of "Original Black Light".</p>
<p>boom-</p>
<p>In an instant, there was silence from the beginning to the end, and the seven-color divine light that was as steady as an old dog broke out with an unprecedented change.</p>
<p>The seven-color divine light is a dead thing, without any conscious thinking and emotion, it only acts on instinct, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>At this time, it sensed the consciousness of its host, and merged with a kind of divine light. Well, although it is different from the white light it was originally designed to swallow, it is a logical black light, but how can the seven-color divine light care about this?</p>
<p>The purpose of its existence is to summarize all the nine colors of divine light, whether it is white light or black light, it is one of the goals.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes showed strange colors, and he didn't dare to make any changes. He let the seven-color divine light escape and slowly flowed out.</p>
<p>If it is compared to strength and weakness, he is definitely not as good as the seven-colored light, but compared to wisdom, this group of dead things can't keep up!</p>
<p>The seven-color divine light has been lurking in the depths of his consciousness, and there are two conditions for activation. One is that he integrates concepts to break through the narrative, and the second is to integrate logic white light.</p>
<p>In fact, in the instinctive estimation of the seven-color divine light, once Bai Donglin breaks through the narrative and the power is nowhere to be advanced, he will start to seek the power of logic and integrate the white light, and that is the time for him to appear and harvest the fruits of victory. .</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>But Bai Donglin noticed this, and destroyed the world again and again in order to avoid this dangerous situation, so he managed to bypass the breakthrough narrative level to avoid awakening the seven-color divine light, and used the power of the eddy current and the source to control the logic white light in a roundabout way. .</p>
<p>Until this world, successfully controlling the white light, can we use the power of logic to run through the previous lives, revise the illogical places, calculate the black light from the beginning, and plan the logical black light.</p>
<p>Devouring the black light is only one of the purposes, and taking the opportunity to draw out the seven-color divine light is also the top priority. Otherwise, this time bomb will always be lurking in the consciousness, and it will always be a factor of instability.</p>
<p>The seven-color divine light acts according to its instincts. It takes the consciousness of the assimilated primordial black light as Bai Donglin, and perceives the logical black light that has been merged.</p>
<p>The fruit is already ripe, and it is right in front of you. What is there to hesitate?</p>
<p>Qi-color Shenguang abandoned Bai Donglin without hesitation, rushed out impatiently, and rushed towards the "Original Black Light". The breath of the logic black light was so tempting that it had already hooked its soul. go.</p>
<p>With the complete separation of the seven-color divine light, Bai Donglin's enlightenment, immortality, damage reversal, and transcendence, these three talents have also dissipated. My heart was empty at first, and then I felt an unprecedented ease, as if a boulder on my heart was swept away.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, although I have to admit that these talents gave him unparalleled help and advantages in the early and middle stages of his cultivation, but now that he has mastered the logic and the consciousness of nothingness, the talents have become tasteless, and they will never be abandoned. pity.</p>

<p>At the moment when the seven-color divine light was attached to the "Original Black Light", Bai Donglin's eyes lit up, and an unprecedented dazzling brilliance erupted, faintly visible.</p>
<p>"Idiot! You've been fooled!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"Drink-"</p>
<p>"No no meaning! Rotation!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>boom! stop-</p>
<p>"Original Black Light" opened his eyes and looked at Bai Donglin's dazzling eyes. A strange stream of light flashed through the hole of the childless prodigy, wrapped in a light group of consciousness combined with logic black light, which appeared directly in Bai Donglin's eyes. In Donglin's consciousness, it violated logic and did not cross the distance of time and space at all.</p>
<p>The seven-color divine light that had just merged into the body of consciousness, immediately found that the place where he was was just a body of consciousness that had lost its essence and was shattered, not to mention the black light of logic, not even a single hair.</p>
<p>Although he was put together, the seven-color divine light didn't understand what anger was at all. As soon as he sensed the black light of logic on Bai Donglin's body, he was extremely honest and dutiful.</p>
<p>It was hard to get rid of this difficult thing, Bai Donglin avoided it like a snake, how could he do what he wanted! ?</p>
<p>"retreat!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, after recovering the consciousness light ball, it was not even too late to swallow the logic black light, Bai Donglin stepped out, instantly escaped from the original black light's mind, and used logic to create an infinite layer of time and space, escaping to infinity.</p>
<p>"swallow-"</p>
<p>He is in control of the power of logic, and Bai Donglin naturally knows how terrifying this power is. The infinite barriers and distances can't stop the seven-color divine light at all. The opportunity may only be for a moment. He needs more powerful power and needs to swallow the black light immediately.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>"what!?"</p>
<p>After the strange humming, Bai Donglin widened his eyes in surprise. At this moment, his left eye was pure white and his right eye was dark, all haunting the power of terrifying logic. There is a strange pattern of black and white intertwined.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>The breath is faint, mysterious and unpredictable.</p>
<p>"It went so well?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin felt the earth-shaking changes in himself, and the shock in his heart was hard to disappear. He knew exactly what happened to the original black light. This logical black light was full of endless extreme negativity. success.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in just an instant, he swallowed the black light, which was greatly unexpected.</p>
<p>Before his consciousness broke through, Bai Donglin thought that only the consciousness transformed by the seven-color divine light could successfully integrate the logic divine light. Now, it seems that his consciousness of the realm of nothingness is stronger than he imagined, and he has a strong understanding of the divine light. Light has a strong holding capacity.</p>
<p>"In this way, I may be able to carry more than one kind of logical divine light, and even swallow the seven-color divine light!?"</p>
<p>As soon as this idea came up, Bai Donglin was shocked. He didn't have this plan at first. The biggest goal was to disperse the seven-color divine light, so that its power was divided, and it could not threaten him.</p>
<p>It's not that he's not greedy enough, his nature has never changed. The reason for this plan is because after countless deductions, a creature, an independent self-consciousness, can only carry a kind of logical divine light, no matter how much more. There will be conflicts, and even Shenguang will achieve integration and unity in consciousness, and the anti-customer will be the main.</p>
<p>He is only devouring the logic black light now. The white light is not considered fusion, but is only indirectly controlled by the source point.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin was not going to take this risk, but the unexpected power of Wuwuzhi made him think about it and prepare to give it a try.</p>
<p>"coming!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>While thinking about it, the electric light and flint didn't even take a moment. The black light of the original source, which was dominated by the seven-color divine light, had already crossed the many domains and fled to the front. Wushen's eyes flashed with colorful brilliance, staring straight at Bai Donglin, the strange expression of ruthlessness, greed, and abnormal greed made one's heart tremble.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Without the slightest stagnation, the seven-colored divine light did not know what fear and temptation were, but just followed instinct, walked on foot, raised his fist and banged. It has only one purpose, which is to re-enter Bai Donglin's consciousness and swallow it together with the logical black light.</p>
<p>"Damn things!"</p>
<p>"You thought I was the prey to be slaughtered?!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes were cold, and his breath was violent and whistling. He had suppressed the anger of endless years, and was completely ignited by the sight of the seven-color divine light.</p>
<p>Who is the prey? Who is the hunter?</p>
<p>Today, I will be the worst and strongest hunter!</p>
<p>"kill-"</p>
<p>Without retreating, Bai Donglin's brows were shining brightly, black and white flowed, and the beams of light gushing out of his eyes directly cut off the body of the original black light, and then a terrifying punch, lingering with the power of black and white logic, infinite heavens. The power of eddy currents, the power of consciousness of the realm of nothingness...</p>
<p>All the powers, merged into one, and the seven-color divine light clashed violently.</p>
<p>Silently, the strange realm that exists only in logic is filled with endless brilliance, black and white intertwined, and seven colors surge.</p>
<p>The logic of disorder and corruption has become abstract and distorted in the process of pulling. I don't know how many heavens and how many fields of nothingness are born, destroyed and endlessly reincarnated under the light.</p>
<p>Two figures beyond imagination, standing on the logic, infinitely huge and infinitely small, in every moment of collision, the body wrapped in the power of concept will fight countless times.</p>
<p>Flesh and blood, fragments of consciousness, and wanton splashing, every drop of blood that rushes away contains terrifying mighty power. Wherever it passes, all time, space, and heaven are wiped out, and there is nothing left.</p>

<p>"happy!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"Kill! Kill! Kill—"</p>
<p>Boom! Kacha!</p>
<p>The mighty power of extreme tyranny really hit that shattering, even the absolute "nothing" was crushed, and even the logic was torn apart.</p>
<p>No words, no vocabulary, can describe this war.</p>
<p>Even if it is a detached creature and exhausts its imagination, it cannot be described in case it can only be measured by the damage caused by a little aftermath, and it will also be terrified.</p>
<p>"Seven-color divine light!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"You are indeed very strong, strong, strong enough to make all existence despair, but it is not enough to return to my consciousness..."</p>
<p>The more the battle became fiercer, Bai Donglin became stronger and stronger. Gradually, from the initial disadvantage, after countless fights, he had already integrated his own strength, and after the logic had been operated to the extreme, he instead suppressed the seven-colored divine light violently. hammer.</p>
<p>"You, you are just the aggregate of seven logical forces, one side of Jane!"</p>
<p>"As for me, I have the simplicity of logic black light, the complexity of logic white light, and the most splendid flower in the universe - the consciousness of the realm of nothingness!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"You are going to lose."</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Bai Donglin had already punched his fist on the eyebrows of the seven-color Shenguang, and the infinite power poured out and spread, and the original black light's body finally couldn't stand the destruction, was broken away by logic, turned into nothingness and dissipated.</p>
<p>The body of the seven-color divine light, a group of invisible spheres shimmering with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue, and purple radiance, revealed, undulating together, floating in nothingness.</p>
<p>"broken-"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin shrank in Tong Kong, his figure twisted and stretched, merged with logic, turned into black and white spikes lingering with many mighty powers, and suddenly, across an inexplicable trajectory, directly piercing the seven-color divine light.</p>
<p>"Humph!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Perceiving the seven-color divine light infecting his consciousness, Bai Donglin's invisible eyes turned cold, and then the black and white spikes collapsed, directly turning into a sphere, embedded in the hollow where the seven-color divine light was penetrated.</p>

<p>"Drink!</p>
<p>Open it for me-"</p>
<p>Boom!呲!</p>
<p>A round of black and white intertwined light wheels swelled wildly in the center of the seven-color divine light. Every moment, there was infinite might and bright consciousness, colliding with the seven-color light in contact.</p>
<p>The formless and intangible logical divine light actually made an awkward cracking sound, and then it was continuously expanded. The seven-color divine light was no longer in the shape of a sphere, but became a light wheel formed by connecting seven colors.</p>
<p>The seven-color light wheels are not perfectly and completely integrated. Where they are connected in pairs, the stretch is the most serious, and there is even a limit of disconnection.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>A little bit, a little bit...</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes were bright, and he had seen the hope of victory. He couldn't help but continue to squeeze his own strength, in order to break the seven-color light wheel and completely split the seven kinds of logical light.</p>
<p>"Humph! Want to escape!?"</p>
<p>Seven-color Shenguang was scared. Although it had no emotions, it instinctively knew the situation it faced, and also knew how to make a choice that was beneficial to itself, just as it chose Bai Donglin as its host to seek logical white light.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin, through the seven-colored light that kept shrinking and no longer confronted him head-on, understood the retreat of the seven-colored light, and couldn't help showing a sneer.</p>
<p>Come as you want, leave as you want, treat him like nothing! ?</p>
<p>Now that the offense and defense have reversed, want to leave? First ask him if he will answer!</p>
<p>"almost…"</p>
<p>Whispering in a low voice, the brilliance of black and white logic, intertwined to create the silhouette of the lake, stepping on the light wheel, chanting loudly.</p>

<p>Strange whimpering and humming resounded through the endless nothingness, and the yin wind roared, monstrous to the sky.</p>

<p>Roaring and filial piety, as if there are endless beings, praying in the midst of extinction, the infinitely wise beings, sacrifice everything, turn into heroic spirits, watch one lifetime, another lifetime...</p>
<p>Kacha! Kacha!</p>
<p>The nothingness shattered one after another, and pieces of pebbles shimmering with brilliance shot out, and under the endless brilliant light, the simple and beautiful words on them were vaguely visible.</p>
<p>Hei Cang, Chi Ming, Yin Shi, Jin Tai, Qing Yi, Xuan Yin, Ri Ji!</p>
<p>Of the seven pebbles, five of them are engraved with the coordinates of opening Bai Donglin's crossing passage, helping him escape from the cage of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>"Xuanyin" is engraved with ancient information, which makes the detached from all ethnic groups pull the detached from the black disaster to confront each other, so that they have no time to take into account the reality, and let Bai Donglin take the opportunity to understand the power of the eddy current, leap into the sacred timeline, and awaken the light of detachment , disappeared under the observation of many transcendental beings.</p>
<p>The stone of "sun filth" drives the Lord to provoke a battle to encircle and suppress the original black light, and fill in the final link for Bai Donglin's plan!</p>
<p>Seven stones, seven generations, this means that Bai Donglin has restarted at least seven generations, and there are seven generations of sentient beings, endless heavens, collapsed in this small cobblestone.</p>
<p>"Cough cough, they're all back."</p>
<p>Seven-colored Shenguang gave up entanglement, and only wanted to escape, causing Bai Donglin's pressure to rise sharply, his own strength had been squeezed to the limit, and he could only ask for the strength of his previous life.</p>

<p>"The meaning of our existence is to watch endless years in infinite loneliness, and what we do is this moment."</p>

<p>The whirlpool of the heavens in the seven directions, carrying endless matter and the will of the heroic spirit, burns everything, and turns into seven swords of seven colors, which are held in the hands of Mohu's figure and chopped down at the same time.</p>
<p>This is a sword that burns everything, this is the power of a lifetime, the will and expectations of endless creatures are attached to it, and the sword is cut out, and the shadow of the lake and the vortex of the heavens dissipate into nothing at the same time.</p>
<p>cut! cut! cut!</p>
<p>The seven swords and Hua Zhan, respectively, slashed above the seven-color logic divine light. Compared with Bai Donglin's strength at this time, although it was a little weak, at this moment it became the last straw that overwhelmed the camel.</p>
<p>Boom! Kacha —</p>
<p>broken!</p>
<p>The seven-color divine light cracked!</p>
<p>Its mellow and uniform form collapsed completely, each of which was an independent logical divine light. The moment it was confused and suspended in place, it was instinctive and wanted to fly away.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! I want to escape, it's really late now!"</p>
<p>The logical divine light of their own affairs, where is the opponent of Bai Donglin who is so invincible now, while chatting and laughing, his palms stick out again and again, and all the seven groups of divine light are captured in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>"Hey, arrogant? Why aren't you arrogant? Come, come, I will expand my consciousness, you continue to devour me!?"</p>
<p>Chill out! Very relieved!</p>
<p>The suppressed qi in his heart completely dissipated, and while Bai Donglin breathed a sigh of relief, his mind was suddenly stunned, winning? Is it really over? !</p>

<p>Bai Donglin shook his head and laughed. With his state of mind, he would lose his temper for a while, which shows how difficult and difficult this journey has been.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, his life is relatively easy. Those who have been forced to the end of the road again and again and have to destroy the world and restart are the most difficult. I can't imagine the pain and loneliness in it. , cut out the key sword.</p>
<p>"Thank you, the past self, there are endless heavens and sentient beings."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin bowed and bowed. Although they were all of their own lives, their selfless sacrifices are worthy of being remembered and grateful, and they need to be respected with the utmost respect.</p>
<p>"It's time to deliver on the promise."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin murmured softly, and then stepped on his feet, and the "domain of nothingness", which was the same as before, was created by the power of logic.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the golden divine timeline manifested, his fingers twisted between his brows, and the vortexes of the heavens that turned into memories and many transcendental ones returned to reality.</p>
<p>"The dead return, the heavens are recast!"</p>
<p>If the mind moves again, those who have been wiped out under the army of the black disaster, the endless heavens, and countless sentient beings, have all recovered perfectly, and the vortex of all races and heavens has returned to its peak state. swirl.</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't expect that I would destroy nine worlds in total, tsk, I'm so cruel!"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin closed his eyes slightly, and after thinking about it, he still decided not to treat those who sacrificed for the ninth generation. After all, in the end, they didn't complain and still chose to give everything.</p>
<p>"Logic! Phaseless Nine Realms! Both are true! The same origin! Do not interfere with each other! Li-"</p>
<p>In a single thought, the logic was tampered with, and a new supreme iron law was written. The ninth world that was once wiped out, the infinite heavens and the endless beings, with a concept beyond "parallel", exist in the symbiosis of no phase, except for Other than him, even the narrative-level detachment cannot perceive each other's existence.</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>The ninth world, plus the present world, these ten worlds are essentially the same, and there are ninety percent similarities.</p>
<p>, and countless identical creatures. If you are in the same domain, you will be in constant trouble, so it is the best way to deal with it.</p>
<p>"So, it can be considered complete, forget all kinds of pain and suffering, and go through the world again!"</p>
<p>Today, only Bai Donglin controls the power of logic. Without the shackles of the rest of the logic, it can be said with absolute certainty that he can do everything, truly omnipotent.</p>
<p>Resurrection of the infinitely huge vortex of the heavens, involving countless creatures, is only a single thought, and it is extremely easy.</p>
<p>"Ah? This, here is it? Where is the original black light?!"</p>
<p>At this time, those detached people who were released came back to their senses and remembered why they were here, to encircle and suppress the black light of Yuanchu, but looking around, it was peaceful, where is the shadow of the black light of Yuanchu?</p>
<p>‘Bai…, did you kill Yuanchu Black Light? ’</p>
<p>Huang Tiandi narrowed his eyes slightly, shook hands, felt the surging power in his body, and confirmed that this was reality, not an illusion. They had already burned everything to death, why did they come back to life?</p>
<p>Everyone present, it is estimated that only Huang Tiandi guessed something, and looked at Bai Donglin not far away with strange eyes, and it was not easy to ask questions in front of everyone, so he could only press it for the time being.</p>
<p>"Everyone, the catastrophe has passed, and the world has returned to peace. While everyone is here, I have an announcement."</p>
<p>Bai Donglin spoke slowly, although it was calm and unwavering, it contained special magic power, which made all those who were detached could not help but focus their attention.</p>
<p>"Black disasters, including the original black light, have all been slaughtered."</p>
<div class="ads"><amp-ad class="inarticle-ads" width="728" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2738082324084484" data-ad-slot="9693565886" data-auto-format="fixed-height" data-full-width="true" layout="responsive"><div overflow></div></amp-ad></div><p>Po Lun Kshadi, Azathoth, and other grass on the wall, it was useless to leave it, and naturally he was crushed to death by him.</p>
<p>"The aliens have bad thoughts in their hearts, and they plot against my human race. The sin is unforgivable, and I will kill them all at once."</p>
<p>Although he threw out the bait for the "sun filthy" cobblestone, all actions and various plans were the willing actions of the alien race. Without his intervention, the alien race would have attacked the human race sooner or later.</p>
<p>hiss-</p>
<p>Hearing Bai Donglin say such brutal things in a calm tone, everyone present couldn't help but take a deep breath, but secretly, they felt extremely happy in their hearts.</p>
<p>"Although it is not my race, its heart must be different, but if my human race wants to develop continuously and stably, it is indispensable to be supervised by external threats, and at least there must be a place to vent violence to avoid internal friction."</p>
<p>"Ten thousand steps back, the little guys below always have to eat blood, right? Therefore, it is necessary for alien creatures to exist, and there is no need to exterminate them, but..."</p>
<p>"The destructive power of the detached person is too powerful. I have set the underlying logic. Anyone who is not my human race cannot achieve detachment!"</p>
<p>"In addition, the common language of the human race, Chinese, is designated as Daowen, which is common to all heavens, and it is a million times more difficult for foreign races to master it."</p>
<p>As soon as the words are said, the logic is established. This is a dimensionality reduction attack at the literal level, making it difficult for foreign races to steal the magical treasures of the human race.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's words were cold and stern, as long as there were no detached people born from alien races, no matter how many little guys on the other side appeared, any one of them, Huang Tiandi, would be enough to calm down all the chaos, and he didn't need to do everything by himself.</p>
<p>He has worked so hard for so long, and finally all his hardships have come to fruition. In the endless years that follow, he just wants to enjoy life.</p>
<p>After saying that, ignoring the stunned crowd, Bai Donglin walked away and paced back to Yujing Mountain.</p>
<p>"Father!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Bai Yuan felt something in his heart, his blood pulses were pulsing, and he rushed out of the hall instinctively.</p>
<p>"father-"</p>
<p>"Tsk tsk tsk, is he our father? Oh, young, so heroic! Much better than the picture! Hahaha, I finally saw my real father!"</p>
<p>Why does this girl have such a personality like him? The mouth is quite poisonous, Bai Donglin frowned, but the corners of his mouth rose unconsciously, revealing a soft smile.</p>
<p>"Yuan'er, and you two girls, go and wake up your mother."</p>
<p>"I've slept for ten immeasurable generations, and I'm not afraid of **** pain."</p>
<p>"Pfft-"</p>
<p>"Giggle! The child obeys!"</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After a boundless period of time, the top of Yujing Mountain.</p>
<p>"Why is this?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin frowned, looking at the restless seven groups of logical lights in his palm, with a puzzled look on his face.</p>
<p>If there is anything in the world that can stum him, it is only the divine light of logic. After many attempts, he has failed, and he has not swallowed any kind of divine light of logic.</p>
<p>His consciousness of the realm of nothingness is indeed as infinitely powerful as expected, even swallowing the seven groups of divine lights at the same time, he can bear it, and can control them not to fuse together.</p>
<p>But the problem is that as soon as these logical divine lights enter consciousness, they lose their "logic" and not only cannot be swallowed, but also become a useless stream of illusory light.</p>
<p>"The divine light of logic, itself, is the embodiment of logic, nothing more, but that's it..."</p>
<p>"When it merges with the consciousness of living beings, it undergoes an essential change and becomes a logical authority dominated by the will of living beings."</p>
<p>"Logical authority cannot coexist and cannot be integrated. Even if it is forcibly restrained in consciousness, it will not give me any more power."</p>
<p>"Tsk, tasteless!"</p>
<p>Finally, the greed in Bai Donglin's heart dissipated. He was already invincible and strong, and his desire for power was not large, and no amount of power was useless.</p>
<p>"Go, create a new world, maybe, there will be existences that can carry you."</p>
<p>stop-</p>
<p>Six Logic Divine Lights shot out from the Yujing Sacred Mountain, and disappeared in an instant as if they were running for their lives.</p>
<p>Bai Donglin forcibly left behind a logical divine light, which was sealed in the depths of his consciousness, even if it was useless.</p>
<p>He does not think that there will be another existence in the human race that can bring consciousness to the realm of nothingness in a short period of time. To do so is just to set up an insurance.</p>
<p>"Reborn Financial Giants"</p>
<p>His power is enough to easily crush the logical divine light after the fusion of the six paths, that's all.</p>
<p>"White light breeds all races, and black light breeds black disasters. What kind of creatures will these six divine lights breed?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin slowly got up and looked at the sky, watching the endless prosperous heavens. In my heart, I thought to myself, the castrated aliens are not enough to become the pressure of the human race. After a long time, the ethnic group will surely fall into the corruption of comfort.</p>
<p>Perhaps, there will be some powerful foreign enemies like black disasters, and let the people grow up in the expedition. This is the kingly way.</p>
<p>With him suppressing everything, he is not afraid of playing with fire and setting himself on fire.</p>
<p>"I don't know, which lucky one can control the power of logic and become the next logic controller?"</p>
<p>"Oh, UU reading www.uukanshu.com is worth looking forward to because of the unknown."</p>
<p>"Isn't it?"</p>
<p>Bai Donglin's eyes were filled with brilliance, and visions suddenly appeared in the depths of Tong Kong. There were several stalwart figures standing among them, looking back and looking at him at the same time.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!"</p>
<p>"Fun! Interesting!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Laughter echoed on the top of the mountain, leaving a series of footprints on the white snow, and Bai Donglin had already paced towards the hall.</p>
<p>The gray sky above his head reflects the endless heavens.</p>
<p>Like stars, shining brightly.</p>
<p>Eternal, immortal.</p>
